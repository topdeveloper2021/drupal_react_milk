An annual gathering, held this year at the Beverly Hilton April 24-26, the Global Conference is unlike the typical gathering of VIPs. The trade publication Conferenza described it this way in a 2005 report: \"Like the World Economic Forum at Davos, it was impossible to walk away from the Global Conference without a better understanding of the problems plaguing our world. Unlike Davos, however, there was a strong focus at the event on actually trying to come up with ways that many of these problems can be solved ... The Global Conference is today a must-attend event.\" This three-day gathering provides unparalleled access to senior leaders from business, finance, government, education, health care and the news media, who meet to discuss, debate and find solutions to some of the world\u2032s most pressing policy challenges.

The event draws more than 2,500 attendees, including scores of journalists, who choose from some 100 sessions. \"These are decision makers from a variety of disciplines who you ordinarily wouldn\u2032t have together in one room,\" said Institute President and CEO Michael Klowden. Invitation-only events begin Saturday night, April 22nd prior to the formal conference launch on Monday morning, April 24th. Sessions include: \"The Future of Health Care,\" with acting FDA Commissioner Andrew von Eschenbach, AMA President J. Edward Hill, GE Healthcare CEO Joe Hogan, BIO President and CEO James Greenwood, and National Health Council President Myrl Weinberg.<br> \"Global Overview\" with Czech Republic President Vaclav Klaus, Nobel laureate Gary Becker and Carlyle Group founder David Rubenstein.<br> \"The New Philanthropists and the Future of Medical Research Funding,\" featuring Lance Armstrong, philanthropist Eli Broad, Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation President\/CEO Carl Schramm and Institute Chairman Michael Milken.<br> \"Global Risk: What Should Be Keeping You Up at Night,\" with former NATO Commander and presidential candidate Wesley Clark and David Gordon, Vice Chairman of the National Intelligence Council.<br> \"Pension Obligations and Corporate Restructuring Opportunities\" with Frederick Brace, COO and Chief Restructuring Officer of the UAL Corporation, and Bradley Belt, Executive Director of the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation.<br> \"Baby Boom - Baby Bomb?
