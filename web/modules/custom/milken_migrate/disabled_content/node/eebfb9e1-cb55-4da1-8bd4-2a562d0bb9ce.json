But it is entirely possible that the failure to intervene, Thaksin-style, to prevent growing income inequality in Asia will sooner or later derail the continent\u2032s rush to affluence.\" <b>Jeffrey Frankel<\/b>, former economic advisor to President Clinton, offers a primer on the latest threat to the stability of the international capital flows that power globalization. \"About 10 years ago, the phrase 'carry trade' made the leap from investment bank trading rooms to the Markets section of The Wall Street Journal.

My guess, though, is that the notion of the carry trade and its implications are still Greek to all but the most devoted consumers of financial news.\" <b>Barry Eichengreen<\/b> analyzes Europe\u2032s efforts to regain economic leadership after decades of stop-and-go growth and chronically high unemployment. \"To be sure, the productivity payoff has been modest.
