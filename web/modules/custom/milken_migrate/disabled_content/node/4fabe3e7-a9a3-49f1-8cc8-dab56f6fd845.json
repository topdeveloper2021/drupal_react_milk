What's yet to be determined is whether this new and improved version of the ancien regime can deliver.\"Paul Rivlin, an economist at Tel Aviv University, outlines the depths to which the Palestinian economy has fallen. \"Yet it has significant potential to grow rapidly, to tap an underemployed work force, to generate a living standard superior to that of other Arab states that don't happen to sit on top of oceans of oil,\" he concludes. \"Peace with Israel is the key to progress.
