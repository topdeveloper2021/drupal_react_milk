    "value": "LOS ANGELES - The U.S. electrical grid is suffering from more than 25 years of declining investment, and although last year\u2032s federal stimulus bill was a step in the right direction, the $11 billion in authorized funding can\u2032t begin to meet the estimated costs of overhauling this critical infrastructure, says a new report from the Milken Institute.\n<b>\"Financial Innovations for Infrastructure Finance: The Grid, Renewables and Beyond\"<\/b> proposes new regulatory models and the implementation of financial innovation to harness the capital markets and leverage private-sector investment to make up the difference. \"There is a lot of time and effort being wasted arguing about how much it will cost to update the grid,\" said Joel Kurtzman, head of the Milken Institute\u2032s Center for a Sustainable Energy Future. \"But we can agree that what the government has to invest isn\u2032t enough. So it\u2032s time to engage the capital markets and private investment to build the infrastructure we need for a more sustainable and secure economic future.\" The report outlines several options for new regulatory models and financial innovations that could unlock private investment to update transmission infrastructure, increase capacity to deliver renewable energy to population centers and move toward tomorrow\u2032s \"smart\" grid. \"On one hand, the nation\u2032s grid policies must be clearly stated and designed for the long term,\" the report notes. \"On the other, the investment and financial communities must see in those policies the opportunity to deploy capital profitably over the long haul.\" The report includes a description and discussion on the following proposals: <b>Regulatory proposals:<\/b>\n<b>Define and implement national sustainability standards. <\/b>Such standards would allow the players to better compare the social and environmental costs and benefits of various renewable energy projects, energy-efficiency initiatives and transmission-network developments.
