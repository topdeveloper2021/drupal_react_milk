Elements include coursework leading to a certificate in capital markets from GW, and professional internship assignments across the financial industry. Internship providers range from regulatory agencies and development finance institutions to investment managers, venture capital and private equity firms. Sponsor companies include\u00a0Clayton Dubilier\u00a0& Rice, Prospect Capital, Vista Equity Partners and WorldQuant, among others.Michael Milken, chairman of the Milken Institute, hosted a gathering in\u00a0Washington D.C.\u00a0to introduce the new class of IFC-Milken Institute fellows to high-level financial industry representatives. The fellows discussed their personal and professional experiences, sharing insights on financial market challenges and evolutions in Haiti, Liberia, Kenya, Pakistan, Zambia and the Gambia.\"Future economic and social progress in the world's developing nations depends far less on natural resources and more on entrepreneurial talent and access to capital,\" said Milken. \"Robust capital markets combined with informed leadership are needed to create jobs, improve education and develop infrastructure for rapidly growing populations. The IFC-Milken Institute Capital Markets Program is preparing a new generation of leaders to help assure that these societies enjoy a more prosperous and meaningful future.\"Jingdong Hua, vice president and treasurer of IFC (which co-sponsors the program) highlighted the importance played by robust capital markets in enabling countries to reach their full economic potential. He remarked, \"Once you have a cadre of champions of capital markets, they will have an accelerated trajectory of providing finance to the private sector, and ultimately help to fight poverty.\"Vivek Choudhury, dean of The\u00a0George Washington University School of Business, noted \"At GWSB, we like to say that we are 'Engaging the World from the nation's Capital.' I can think of no better example than the Capital Markets Program, sponsored by the Milken Institute and IFC. The fellows are emerging leaders of their respective nations and we are proud to play a part in their professional development. This is a perfect case of an educational program that will make a difference in the world and change lives.\"\"The best thing I am getting out of the program is learning from such an experienced cohort \u2013 nations like\u00a0Kenya\u00a0and\u00a0Nigeria\u00a0are teaching me that it's not a one-size-fits-all solution and that it is important to tailor policy to your economy,\" explained\u00a0Louis-Olivier Verret, an IFC-Milken Institute Fellow and senior officer at the Central Bank of\u00a0Haiti. His classmate Mortima Ketter, also an IFC-Milken Institute Fellow and senior analyst at the Central Bank of\u00a0Liberia, summarized his expectations for the internship, \"In order for me to understand your behavior in your market, I have to work for you. That is what I will take back home so that I can effectively manage market players.\"The Milken Institute and IFC have expanded the global reach of the program this year, by welcoming seven fellows from\u00a0Asia\u00a0and the\u00a0Caribbean\u00a0in addition to the fourteen from\u00a0Africa. The program directors for the Milken Institute and IFC, Carole Biau and\u00a0Divya Nair, noted that the proportion of women has also doubled since the program was launched, reaching nearly half the class.The alumni network is one of the most valuable components of the program. Several alumni from the inaugural class, who graduated in\u00a0April 2017, have assumed new or additional responsibilities following the IFC-Milken Institute Capital Markets Program fellowship.For example,\u00a0Walter Pacheco\u00a0has gone from heading the Market Development unit of the Angolan Capital Markets Commission to working as executive director for\u00a0Angola's\u00a0new Stock Exchange \u2013 and met with the current class of fellows during a work trip to\u00a0Washington D.C.\u00a0Immaculate Nakato and\u00a0Stephen Birungi, both program alumni from\u00a0Uganda, have been increasing the level of policy dialogue between their country's Central Bank and Capital Markets Authority since they graduated.The application period for 2018-19 Fellowships opens\u00a0November 1, 2017.
