That question was left unanswered by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act - and today the future of one of the most stable and profitable segments of the banking industry remains in doubt.Dodd-Frank extended a moratorium on new charters for commercially-owned industrial loan companies (ILCs) that had initially been put in place for all ILCs in 2006. It also directed the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to study whether industrial banks pose any special threat to the stability of the financial system.

Wal-Mart does, however, operate a full-service bank in Mexico and could own banks in most of the foreign jurisdictions in which it operates. \"It seems paradoxical that an individual can own both a bank and a company, and yet that company itself cannot invest in a bank,\" added Barth.\n<b>Background<\/b><b> ILCs arose in 1910 based on the desire of various companies to organize bank subsidiaries to run an existing financial operation in a more reliable and cost-effective manner, or to develop new financial programs that complement their other business lines. Prior to the moratorium, a handful of states approved charters that allowed commercial firms to invest in industrial banks, contributing to the availability of credit, and without a single failure. Examples today include ILCs owned by BMW, GE, Pitney Bowes, Target and Harley-Davidson.\nThe federal moratorium on granting charters to new commercially-owned ILCs was a response to protests against an application by Wal-Mart to form a new ILC in 2005. Some banks and trade associations opposing Wal-Mart\u2032s banking plans raised concerns that led to the moratorium and eventually to the GAO\u2032s study of the industry.\nThe GAO will recommend to Congress what should happen to ILCs when the moratorium expires.

The available evidence suggests that ILCs have operated in a safe and sound manner, and as a group they have a lower percentage of troubled assets than the banking industry as a whole. They are significantly and consistently more profitable as well. ILCs in aggregate have a significantly higher ratio of capital to assets (16.7 percent) than the banking industry as a whole at 11.3 percent, (all figures based on FDIC data for the third quarter of 2010). ILCs have a significantly lower percentage of troubled assets (15 percent) than the banking industry as a whole (31 percent). Commercially owned ILCs in particular have the lowest percentage of troubled assets of all banks (2.35 percent). These institutions are significantly and consistently more profitable, with a higher return on assets (2.18 percent), than the banking industry as a whole (0.56 percent). As a group, commercially owned ILCs are the most profitable banks in the nation (with a 2.97 percent ROA).
