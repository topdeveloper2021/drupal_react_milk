Previously, he held positions at the Institute of International Finance, Zurich Scudder Investment, the U.S. Department of State and the Federal Reserve Board. Announcing the appointment, Milken Institute chief research officer Ross DeVol said, \"Keith brings keen insight of financial markets to our work, and invaluable experience in both public and private financial institutions.<br\/>? Savard will lead the Institte'9;s efforts in analyzing structural developments in global financial markets, including issues of financial stability, global asset allocation, systemic liquidity, credit conditions, and financial system development. He will also help analyze capital market legislative and regulatory issues relating to economic growth and financial innovation. \"I look forward to working with an exceptional staff and the many distinguished supporters of the Milken Institute, furthering its mission in the crucial area of international finance,<br\/>? said Savard.
