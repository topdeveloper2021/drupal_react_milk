Thus, while <i>prosperous<\/i> principally has a financial meaning, intuition says that it should also apply more broadly, and indeed, by etymology, this is the case: The Middle English\/old French root word, <i>prosperus<\/i>, simply means \u201cdoing well.\u201d So what does it mean to \u201cbe doing well\u201d? One\u2019s first instinct is to answer that it is to be doing \u201cwell enough\u201d\u2014which immediately raises another question: \u201cwell enough\u2014<i>for what<\/i>?\u201d I was struck recently by learning of a finding from a paper published in a leading journal in 2010 surveying hundreds of thousands of reports, which found that \u201cemotional well-being\u201d (a composite measure of \u201chappy feelings\u201d) correlates with annual income but only to a certain level ($75,000)\u2014after which the relationship tops out, and no further improvements in well-being are seen while income continues to increase. Here, the \u201cwell enough\u201d relates to a scientifically defined \u201chappiness,\u201d and the implication is that happiness <i>is<\/i> a function of income but only to a certain point, after which accruing more of it does not bring more happiness. Natural questions then follow: Is there an upper limit to happiness? While one can seemingly accrue almost endless wealth, why does it not continue to promote happiness? Is it that wealth above a certain level starts to become constraining as much as liberating, or is it that there\u2019s only so much happiness one can experience, at least of the sort that can be aided by wealth? Perhaps the answer here relates to how much liberty and power (e.g., made possible by greater wealth) are beneficial to happiness. The source of one\u2019s motivation as an academic may seem abstract to some. While not typically financial, it is often traceable to something implicit. For some, it may be a desire for recognition, while for others, it may be the the more basic and arguably noble <i>desire for <\/i>knowledge and discovery. For me, I think it\u2019s honest to assume that both have played a role, and although I recognize that too much of either may be harmful, it is easier to see and accept this for the former. But is this right? One has only to think of Faust or indeed Oppenheimer\u2019s lament here, the specific relevance of which is great. Is there such a thing as \u201crecognition enough\u201d and \u201cknowledge enough\u201d? One is inclined to answer confidently \u201cyes\u201d to the former, but it is harder to admit that the same is true for knowledge. Coming back to the useful reference standard of happiness, it seems reasonable to assume that at a certain point, it is the <i>quality<\/i> of knowing rather than its quantity that is most important. This is not to say that once one has what might feel like a good handle on a core problem within his or her relevant discipline, it is safe to assume that learning is done\u2014but perhaps the emphasis shifts on to what <i>to do<\/i> with one\u2019s knowledge rather than how one can increase it further. Perhaps the same is true of financial wealth\u2014and it seems right to reflect here on the positive impact of philanthropy on happiness. To close by returning to the central question, for me, <i>prosperity<\/i> in its usual financial sense, is something to be mindful of, as it seems to have a useful limit, beyond which \u201cdoing well\u201d begins to lose meaning and value. The same may be true of other domains in which \u201cdoing well\u201d holds relevance, such as academia. For me, as I presume is the case for most people, \u201cdoing well\u201d should be about <i>happiness<\/i> ahead of wealth, recognition, or knowledge.
