    "value": "NEW YORK - Xinhua Finance and Milken Institute today released updated values for the Chinese Initial Public Offering and Renminbi Pressure indicators, both of which increased in line with China\u2032s robust economic growth.The updated indicator charts can be found at chinaindicators.milkeninstitute.org or www.xinhuafinance.com\/en\/charts\/ipo_rpi.html.\nThe Chinese IPO Indicator for November was 198.8, an 11.2% increase from October. The performance of new securities strengthened, with the IPO market continuing its brisk ascent since the Shanghai and Shenzhen markets reopened to new listings in May. November\u2032s indicator marked a record high for the IPO Indicator. Although it was first released publicly last month, the IPO Indicator calculates monthly values back to December 1997, when the value was set to 100.\nThe double-digit month-over-month increase is largely due to the fast-climbing stock of the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC), China\u2032s largest commercial lender. ICBC launched its IPO on October 27 on the Shanghai and Hong Kong stock exchanges, setting a world record for raising US$19 billion. During November, ICBC\u2032s A share price increased by 15%, while its H share price rose 13%.\nThe IPO Indicator tracks the share price performance of new issues listed on the Shanghai, Shenzhen and Hong Kong stock exchanges. In November, it comprised 64 securities, up from 50 in October. However, James Barth, Senior Fellow of the Milken Institute, remarked that the new ICBC and Bank of China issuances played a dominant role within the market cap-weighted indicator. ICBC and Bank of China will remain in the indicator for 12 months before they are removed, as do all newly listed companies. The performance of those shares will heavily influence the IPO Indicator\u2032s future path.\nReflecting trends in China\u2032s currency market, the Renminbi Pressure Indicator (RPI) continued to rise in September. It edged up 0.75%, to 188.3 from 186.9, maintaining an upward trend in spite of the renminbi\u2032s revaluation in 2005 and continued modest appreciation since then.\nGlenn Yago, Director of Capital Studies at the Milken Institute, stressed, \"Pressure on the currency continues to mount with the actual exchange rate still trading in a fairly narrow band. The intervention in China\u2032s foreign exchange market has been sharply reflected in the now-massive foreign exchange reserve, which recently passed the US$1 trillion milestone. Among its many uses, the RPI gives a qualitative assessment of the role that China is playing in exporting capital to the rest of the world, and thus for mainly the United States.\"\nThe RPI indicates upward or downward pressure on the RMB:USD exchange rate, as determined by changes in three primary factors: the differentials in nominal exchange and interest rates between the U.S. and China, as well as China\u2032s foreign exchange reserves. During the month of September, China\u2032s yuan appreciated by 0.63% against the US dollar, while China accumulated an additional 1.63% in foreign exchange reserves. Interest rates remained steady.\nBoth the IPO Indicator and RPI are calculated monthly and released mid-month. The next releases of the IPO and Renminbi Pressure indicators will be in January, 2007.\nThe two indicators are part of a series of eight economic indicators designed to increase transparency and data quality in China\u2032s burgeoning financial markets. The series applies the world-class index calculation methodologies of Milken Institute, one of the world\u2032s foremost economic and financial think tanks, and the extensive data resources of Xinhua Finance, China\u2032s premier financial information and media service provider. The Xinhua Finance\/ Milken Institute China Indicators are used by asset managers, underwriters, economists, and product developers in assessing China\u2032s market environment in support of investment decision-making.\nAbout Xinhua Finance Limited\nXinhua Finance Limited is China\u2032s unchallenged leader in financial information and media, and is listed on the Mothers board of the Tokyo Stock Exchange (symbol: 9399) (OTC ADRs: XHFNY). Bridging China\u2032s financial markets and the world, Xinhua Finance serves financial institutions, corporations and re-distributors through four focused and complementary service lines: Indices, Ratings, Financial News and Investor Relations.
