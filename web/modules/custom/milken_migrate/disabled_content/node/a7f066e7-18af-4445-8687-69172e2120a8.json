Klowden. \"This isn\u2032t the kind of conference where you sit back and listen to people telling you what you could have learned by skimming their latest books. Panelists prepare intensively, attendees interact, and everyone comes away with a deeper understanding of the issues that affect our lives.\" Over the course of three days, April 18-20, participants from 50 countries will meet at the Beverly Hilton Hotel in Los Angeles. They include corporate and financial executives, Nobel laureates, Pulitzer Prize winners, scientists, money managers, institutional investors, philanthropists, government officials, non-governmental organization representatives, academic experts and journalists. This year\u2032s conference, \"Building a Prosperous Future,\" will examine such issues as the future of Social Security and other entitlement programs; rising health-care costs; the growing global presence of China and India; education reform; biotechnology and the promise of medical breakthroughs; alternative energy sources; global risk; nanotechnology; job creation; global security; the global investment climate; and the latest economic developments in Europe, Asia, Russia, Latin America and the U.S. Among the panelists confirmed to speak are former Vice President Al Gore; Rupert Murdoch, Chairman and CEO, News Corporation; Terry Semel, Chairman and CEO, Yahoo!; Charlene Barshefsky, former U.S. Trade Representative; Mel Karmazin, CEO, SIRIUS Satellite Radio; Steve Forbes, President and CEO, Forbes; William Haseltine, former CEO, Human Genome Sciences; Douglas Holtz-Eakin, Director, Congressional Budget Office; Jonathan Miller, Chairman and CEO, American Online; Mike Milken, Chairman of FasterCures and the Milken Institute; Steve Wynn, President and CEO, Wynn Resorts; Sam Zell, Chairman, Equity Group Investments; and more than 200 others. The conference kicks off with the \"Global Overview\" panel on Monday, April 18, and runs through Wednesday afternoon, April 20, with plenary sessions, breakouts and smaller, more-intimate roundtable discussions and private meetings with key stakeholders held throughout the event. Begun in 1998, the Global Conference has become the largest such gathering in North America. Some 100 journalists from around the world cover the event. The 2005 Global Conference Underwriters confirmed to date are AOL, BNP Paribas and SBI-USA.
