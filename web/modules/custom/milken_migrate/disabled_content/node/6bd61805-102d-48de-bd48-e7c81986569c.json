    "value": "Need a job? You might want to head to Florida, which is creating new jobs a rapid pace. For the second year in a row, Florida metropolitan areas dominate the Milken Institute Best Performing Cities Index, a measurement of where jobs are being created in America. The 2005 Index\u2032s top three metro areas are in Florida, led by this year\u2032s top-ranked metro, Palm Bay-Melbourne-Titusville, followed by last year\u2032s top scorer, Cape Coral-Fort Myers, and Naples-Marco Island, in third place. The Palm Bay-Melbourne-Titusville area is located near the John F. Kennedy Space Center and has a diversified economy with many aerospace and defense-related industries, as well as space-related tourism and a growing number of retirees. Even severe hurricane seasons could not topple Florida\u2032s growth trends. The state\u2032s metros hold not just the index\u2032s top three slots, but five of its top six and 12 of its top 30. \"The state is creating jobs at a prodigious rate,\" said Ross DeVol, the Institute\u2032s director of Regional Economics and the report\u2032s lead author. \"It has all the makings of a job-creating machine: good weather, low costs, a growing population, a strong tourism industry and little heavy manufacturing.\" The 2005 winners have similar characteristics: strong and growing service sectors, a robust recovery in tourism, growing populations and an increase in the number of retirees. As evidence, six metros in the top 20 come from the Southwest, including three in California (Riverside, Santa Barbara and Santa Ana) and two in Arizona (Tucson and Phoenix). The other is Las Vegas. By comparison, the Midwest has none. The top-rated Midwest metro is Madison, Wis., at 35th. Nine of the bottom 10 spots on the index were from the Midwest - five from Michigan and four from Ohio - reflecting the region\u2032s troubled manufacturing sector. Flint, Mich., is at the bottom at No. 200. The top 10 performers (with 2004 ranking in parentheses) of the 200 largest metros: 1.\tPalm Bay-Melbourne-Titusville, Fla. (31) <b>\n2.\tCape Coral-Fort Meyers, Fla. (1)<br>\n3.\tNaples-Marco Island, Fla. (15)<br>\n4.\tMcAllen-Edinburg-Mission, Texas (18)<br>\n5.\tDeltona-Dayton Beach-Ormond Beach, Fla. (5*)<br>\n6.\tOrlando-Kissimmee, Fla. (29)<br>\n7.\tWashington-Arlington-Alexandria, DC-Va.-Md.-W.Va. (11*)<br>\n8.\tFayetteville-Springdale-Rogers, Ark.-Mo.

(10) and Phoenix-Mesa-Scottsdale, Ariz. (15). <b>Small-Cities Rankings:<\/b> In what amounts to a clean sweep, another Florida metro - Fort Walton Beach-Crestview-Destin - also ranked No. 1 on the Institute\u2032s separate listing of America\u2032s smallest 179 metros, followed by Bend, Ore. (2), and Prescott, Ariz. (3). The biggest movers from last year were Bremerton-Silverdale, Wash., which moved up 104 places (122nd to 18th), and Newark-Union, N.J.-Penn., which dropped 101 spots (39th to 140th). Because of changes made to the geographic definitions of metropolitan statistical areas and metropolitan divisions by the Office of Management and Budget, this year\u2032s index has 379 metros - 61 more than last year. Many of the boundaries have changed, which can make comparisons to last year\u2032s ranking difficult in some cases. The index ranks U.S. metros based on their ability to create and sustain jobs. It includes both long-term (five years) and short-term (one year) measurements of employment and salary growth. There are also four measurements of technology output growth, which are included because of technology\u2032s crucial role in regional economic growth. View the rankings.<br>",
