The results show that a business-friendly climate, a vibrant tech industry, and little exposure to the housing bubble kept Texas on stable ground during the economic downturn. Texas cities occupy an unprecedented 11 of the top 25 positions among the 200 largest metro areas as well as five of the top 10. The index ranks metropolitan areas on their ability to create and sustain jobs. Researchers found that metros whose economies are heavy on service industries such as health care and on large government employers like military bases have been shielded from the job losses suffered by cities more closely tied to the housing and financial sectors.\n\"The Great Recession has taken a toll on many cities,\" said Ross DeVol, executive director of economic research at the Milken Institute. \"But those that are sustaining their job markets are doing so through a good mix of high-tech industries, favorable business climates and diversified service-sector industries.
