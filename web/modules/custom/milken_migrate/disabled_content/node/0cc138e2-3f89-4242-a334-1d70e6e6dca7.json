Simon as President of the Center. Simon will head a staff based in Washington, D.C. Established this spring with a board of directors comprised of Nobel laureates in economics and medicine as well as distinguished leaders of health care, business and journalistic groups, CAMS is an independent, nonpartisan organization that will examine the entire medical research process. It will seek ways to shorten the path to cures and improved treatment outcomes for the most deadly and debilitating diseases that create staggering national costs for treatment as well as untold suffering, lost productivity and mortality. The Center will not conduct scientific or clinical medical research. Rather, it will mobilize economists, medical researchers, clinicians, biologists, ethicists, genomics specialists, chemists, physicists, mathematicians, computer scientists, patient advocates, legislative analysts and others to evaluate the entire research process, publish concrete policy recommendations, and provide leadership for their implementation. Through a rigorous and thorough systems analysis of the research process, CAMS will point to new efficiencies that can accelerate scientific discovery. The Center will propose changes in misplaced priorities, sometimes inefficient regulations, and conflicting incentives that slow progress on finding treatments and cures. \"Greg Simon is the perfect person to lead CAMS,\" said Michael L. Klowden, President and CEO of the Milken Institute. \"He is passionate about the need to improve our medical discovery process, and he has a tremendous knowledge of the issues and the people involved in the concerns that the Center will address.\" Simon joins CAMS after being a Principal at Infotech Strategies, a Washington, D.C. consulting firm with special expertise in health technology, biotech, education technology and communication technology. Prior to that, he was CEO of Simon Strategies\/Mindbeam, a consulting firm focused on clients in biotechnology, health care and information technology among other issues. Simon was the chief domestic advisor to Vice President Al Gore from 1993 to 1997, specifically on economic, science and technology issues. He oversaw a number of initiatives, including the programs of the National Institutes of Health, National Cancer Institute, Federal Drug Administration and the Human Genome Project, and the development of the regulatory framework for biotechnology products. He played a leading role in a variety of White House policies and programs, including passage of the Telecommunications Reform Act of 1996; encouraging the development a V-chip-compatible system of television ratings; the space program, particularly the building of the International Space Station; and FDA reform. Prior to work in the White House, Simon served on Gore\u2032s Senate staff as legislative director, and as staff director of the Investigations Subcommittee of the House of Representatives\u2032 Science, Space and Technology Committee. Simon received his bachelor\u2032s degree from the University of Arkansas and his law degree from the University of Washington. He lives in Bethesda, Md., with his wife, Margo Reid, a documentary film producer, and their two children. \"This is a noble and inspiring challenge,\" Simon said. \"We will call on the brightest minds in an urgent effort to accelerate progress against diseases that cause widespread suffering and shorten the lives of millions of people worldwide.\" CAMS will have its own offices and operate independently, though under the auspices of the Milken Institute, an economic think tank whose mission is to improve the lives of people throughout the world through research on crucial public policy issues.
