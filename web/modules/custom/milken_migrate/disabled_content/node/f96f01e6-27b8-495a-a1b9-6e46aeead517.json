Competition at the very top has increased significantly, making it more difficult to break into the top 10. Indeed, the states in the top 10 are the same as those in 2010 and 2012, with only a few changes in rank:The top 10 (with their previous index rankings in 2012)1. Massachusetts (1)<br>2.

Delaware (8)\u201cThis index shows that the science and tech sectors continue to pace the overall economy, as well as the importance of innovation in state economies. States that are traditionally strong in science and technology are building on that strength,\u201d says Klowden.Movers and shakers:Maryland is back at number two, posting its highest score in the history of the index. The state is succeeding in its efforts to attract funding and streamline the process or transforming university research into commercially viable products.California held on to its number three spot, though still below its peak in 2002. The leverage of high-tech industries in Silicon Valley, as well as strong showings in venture capital investment, contributed to the state\u2019s high ranking.\nColorado retained its number four position, but posted its third consecutive drop in score. Utah regained its 2010 rank of number five as it posted gains in four of the index\u2019s five composites. The state has a strong life-sciences sector, as well as an impressive number of high-tech firms.\nNorth Carolina was the biggest gainer, jumping from 21st to 15th, thanks largely to a recovery in its Risk Capital and Entrepreneurial Infrastructure ranking.\nThe State Technology and Science Index is made up of five composites that can be applied across all 50 states for comparison and analysis, with 78 unique indicators. The composites are: research and development inputs, risk capital and entrepreneurial infrastructure, human capital investment, technology and science work force, and technology concentration and dynamism. It is one of the most comprehensive examinations of state technology and science assets ever compiled.Complete rankings and the full report, \u201cState Technology and Science Index 2014: Enduring Lessons for the Intangible Economy,\u201d by Kevin Klowden, Kristen Keough, and Jason Barrett is available for download at no charge at http:\/\/statetechandscience.org\/.
