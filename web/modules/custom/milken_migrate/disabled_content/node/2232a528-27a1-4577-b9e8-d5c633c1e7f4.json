As people seek to live longer, healthier, and more productive lives, they are looking for access to what works specifically for them. Today the innovative life science industry is broadening its scope to embrace new technologies and platforms. New public-private partnerships are developing, and the investment ecosystem is shifting with many new entrants. And those who procure and deliver health systems to societies globally are rethinking sustainable, viable approaches that will have major economic and societal consequences.

This moment in time is founded upon major innovations in science, medicine, and technology. Computing power, artificial intelligence, and deep learning capabilities are rapidly unlocking insights to advance our understanding of populations and individuals and identifying legacy and future interventions that might help researchers seek prevention and cures.
