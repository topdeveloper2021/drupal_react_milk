    "value": "SINGAPORE \u2013 Older populations are growing rapidly in a number of Asian countries. This unprecedented demographic phenomenon may have profoundly adverse impacts on their economies. As working people reach age milestones and exit the labor force, these questions arise: How will the traditional retirement years be financed? What will the future hold for national pension systems? How will the swelling costs of health care impact national budgets? Costs, however, are only part of the story. The greater part is creating value. Though some may mistakenly regard older workers as less productive and their skills obsolete, Asia can\u2019t afford to waste this massive asset.\u201cWisdom in the Workforce: Unlocking the Economic Value of Asia\u2019s Aging Population,\u201d released today by the Milken Institute, evaluates crucial skill shortages and identifies methods to harness the strength of the mature workforce. Further, it points out that with the aid of farsighted public policies and strategic private-sector employment practices, older workers can provide an effective solution that magnifies Asia\u2019s success. The report examines trends and makes policy recommendations for five countries: China, India, Japan, South Korea, and Singapore. Each is grappling with its own unique challenges, but all can tap the power of expanding older populations.\u201cOur objective is to illuminate how demography is remolding Asia\u2019s labor force,\u201d says Anusuya Chatterjee, Milken Institute Fellow and lead author of the report. \u201cThe challenge is in incentivizing and enabling older adults to remain part of the workforce without displacing younger generations of workers.\u201dIn addition to addressing private-sector demand, keeping people employed longer would generate a range of macroeconomic and societal benefits for these nations, including:Mitigating public costs for retirees and pressures on social support systems.Expanding the tax base and government revenue.\nCreating a healthier population, as research suggests that older people who opt to stay in the labor force have fewer ailments in the long run than those who retire.\nThe five nations studied are likely to confront labor shortages within a generation\u2019s time. To overcome such challenges, each requires strategies tailored to its particular conditions:CHINA \u2014 As an engine of global manufacturing, China will have to satisfy escalating demand for technical and manufacturing workers as well as services of all kinds in the coming decades. A possible solution would be to raise retirement ages for Chinese women to parity with men, which could add millions of workers to the labor pool in the coming decades.\nINDIA \u2014 India\u2019s population is younger relative to the other large Asian economies, and it will be difficult to fill positions in high-growth industries because many available workers lack university or vocational training. This is exacerbated by a dearth of teachers in higher education. Transitioning older STEM professionals into the classroom could offer a novel solution.\nJAPAN \u2014 While the Japanese are working longer than most of their peers elsewhere in Asia, it has not been enough to offset severe talent shortages. Barriers to the immigration of skilled workers mean the solutions to such shortages must come from within the country. As health professionals become scarce in the next decade, transitioning older health professionals into flexible or part-time schedules rather than retirement could help to fill the gap.\nSOUTH KOREA \u2014 Most older workers in South Korea are either self-employed or in part-time jobs. One reason few older people are working full-time is that the \u201ctraditional\u201d pay scheme undercompensates employees in the early years of their tenure and overcompensates them in later years. Forty percent of South Korea\u2019s population will be 65 and older in 2040, and the nation\u2019s industries will need to harness the skills of mature workers well beyond their mid-50s. This could be achieved by modernizing compensation schemes and expanding flexible work arrangements.\nSINGAPORE \u2014 Singapore faces the challenge that its growing older population will constrict the supply of qualified labor. Policies that support immigration and a higher birth rate are not sufficient. To tackle these issues, Singapore has implemented innovative policies such as the Retirement and Re-employment Act and WorkPro scheme to integrate the aging workforce.\n\u201cThe Asian economies we examined could benefit from taking a comprehensive approach to retaining and integrating older people in the workplace \u2013 and many efforts are already underway,\u201d says Donald Markwardt, Milken Institute research analyst and co-author of the report. \u201cHarnessing the productive potential of older citizens can turn the \u2018problem\u2019 of aging into a solution for continuing economic growth and prosperity.\u201dClearly, one approach won\u2019t suit every country, but the broad strategy of engaging mature workers has the potential to make a meaningful difference across the region. With this goal in mind, \u201cWisdom in the Workforce\u201d offers six broad recommendations:Enable longer working lives\nCreate age-neutral workplaces\nOffer flexible work arrangements\nIncentivize entrepreneurship\nNurture a culture of mentoring and community\nDevelop a sustainable model for healthy aging\n\u201cWisdom in the Workforce: Unlocking the Economic Value of Asia\u2019s Aging Population,\u201d by Anusuya Chatterjee and Donald Markwardt with Perry Wong, is available for download at no charge at http:\/\/www.milkeninstitute.org\/publications\/view\/740.Human capital issues will be a topic at the second annual Milken Institute Asia Summit, to be held Sept. 17-18 in Singapore.
