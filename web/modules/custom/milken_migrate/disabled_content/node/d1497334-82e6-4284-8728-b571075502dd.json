The Center's research, convening and communications programs engage experts across America and the world who share its mission to improve lives and strengthen societies by enhancing the future of aging.By 2030, one in five U.S. residents will be 65 and older. Globally, the number of people age 60 and over is projected to leap from approximately 900 million to more than 2 billion by 2050. This demographic transformation brings with it both challenges and opportunities to realize a tremendous longevity dividend. Through its collaborative work, the Center is accelerating a needed shift in thinking at this crucial inflection point, and its new digital resource will play a key role.\"Our website will showcase news, events and ideas from those who collaborate in our work,\" said Paul Irving, Chairman of the Center. \"That includes the Center's staff, our accomplished Advisory Board, and other respected organizations in education, health, philanthropy, policy and business.\" For information on the Center's Board, click here.With content from recognized experts, the website's \"CFA Quarterly\" will feature curated insights that advance a conversation about the implications and possibilities of demographic change.\"Population aging deserves much more attention in policy, business and other domains,\" according to Irving. \"While the risks of dependence and disease cannot be minimized, older adults also represent an under-recognized and underutilized human capital asset. Their wisdom and experience enrich their families as well as business, educational and social institutions. They offer perspectives that build intergenerational connection in workplaces, and they boost economic growth as entrepreneurs. They represent a market opportunity as consumers of new products and services.
