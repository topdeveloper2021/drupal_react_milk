But, \"We cannot expect policymakers, investors, business executives and homeowners in the position to influence disaster mitigation to act rationally without a financial nudge and\/or clearly enforced obligations. We need to give people tangible incentives to do the right things.\" Bob Looney, an economist at the Naval Postgraduate School in California, ponders the future of North Korea as its economy implodes. \"Ironically, no one (with the likely exception of the great majority of North Koreans) is eager to see North Korea collapse,\" he writes. \"China doesn\u2032t want a flood of refugees; many South Koreans fear the consequences of the economic dislocation. This doesn\u2032t mean that the economy (and the government) won\u2032t collapse one day. But the push will probably have to come from within.\" Larry White, an economist at New York University\u2032s Stern School of Business (and a former mortgage regulator), dreams of the day Washington eliminates virtually all the subsidies - and much of the waste and volatility - from the market for housing. \"Housing finance can\u2032t be reformed overnight. But the experience of the last few years (in which housing played a key role in triggering a terrible global recession), and the likely experience of the next few (in which the need for deficit reduction will be hard to ignore), could serve as the opening.\" The latest edition also includes Chris Meisner, an economist at the University of California, Davis, on why the 19th century gold standard isn\u2032t a good model for reforming the global financial system; Gary Libecap of the University of California, Santa Barbara, on the need to allow markets to allocate water in the Western U.S.; and an excerpt from Zombie Economics: How Dead Ideas Still Walk Among Us, by economist John Quiggin of the University of Queensland.
