The article is an excerpt from a forthcoming book.\nAlso in this issue:\n<b>Linda Cohen<\/b>, an economist at the University of California, Irvine explains why technological change lies at the heart of a successful climate policy. \"Seemingly modest lifestyle changes, along with technology already available and close to commercialization, could reduce fossil fuel consumption sufficiently to meet limited near-term goals for curbing carbon emissions favored by many climate scientists. But a satisfactory end-game would require dramatically better and cheaper ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Innovation is thus a key component of a long-term climate policy.\"\n<b>Robert Looney<\/b>, an economist at the Naval Postgraduate School in California, writes about Mexico's shining promise - and startling downward spiral. \"Changes are coming to Mexico. Unfortunately, these changes are more likely to resemble the ones seen in the Soviet Union before its collapse than the positive growth-reform-growth dynamic that drives the go-getting economies of Brazil and India. Perhaps Mexicans will summon the collective will to stop the decline. But as things stand now, there is little cause for optimism.\"\nThe <b>McKinsey Global Institute<\/b>, the research arm of McKinsey and Co. offers a big-picture view of what it will take to revive the economies of Western Europe and the United States. \"The key to success in both is increasing productivity in the teeth of unfavorable demographic headwinds. On both sides of the Atlantic, there is room to boost the role that labor plays in growth, and major opportunities to boost productivity through technological change. But both also need to face up to difficult structural impediments if they are to reach their full long-term growth potential.\"\n<b>John Rosenthal<\/b>, a contributing editor at <i>National Geographic Traveler<\/i> and a journalist who writes about business and health, explains why outsourcing medical care has the potential to become far more than a curiosity. \"Once limited to day-trip dental visits to Mexico and furtive escapes to Switzerland for facelifts and tummy tucks, the field known as medical tourism has expanded into a $5 billion industry.
