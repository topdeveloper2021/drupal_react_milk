Since launching in October of 2016, Operation Prevention\u2019s immersive English-and Spanish-language tools have reached more than one million young people ages 8 to18.\u201cOperation Prevention\u2019s mission to educate youth will make a meaningful contribution to the future of our nation\u2019s health. The Lynda and Stewart Resnick Center for Public Health at the Milken Institute is pleased to be a part of the call to action to expand access to and awareness of prevention resources for communities,\u201d\u00a0said Ed Greissing, executive director, Lynda and Stewart Resnick Center for Public Health, Milken Institute. \u201cThis collaboration builds on the Institute\u2019s efforts to extend life, and promote health and wellness at all ages, by using the most effective strategies to empower people in America and across the globe.\u201dThe DEA, Discovery Education and the Milken Institute Center for Public Health will expand the reach of this program to millions more young people, and will be joined by a combined network of educators, advocacy organizations, businesses, think-tanks, and philanthropic institutions in all 50 states. The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), the Substance and Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration's (SAMHSA) Center for Substance Abuse Prevention, and the U.S. Department of Education have contributed content, insights, and best practices to the development of\u00a0Operation Prevention.\u201cThis is an unprecedented epidemic \u2013 its growing and its growing fast. The United States makes up just five percent of the world\u2019s population, but consumes the vast majority of the world\u2019s hydrocodone. That said, it\u2019s not surprising that opioids account for roughly three-fifths of all drug overdoses in the nation,\u201d said\u00a0DEA Acting Administrator Robert W. Patterson. \u201cWe\u2019re proud of the fact that\u00a0Operation Preventionis a free, science-based education tool for students, teachers, and parents. In collaboration with Discovery Education, the Milken Institute, and other key organizations, we are able to make the opioid epidemic understandable for students by teaching them the science behind addiction.\"Requiring no local sponsorship or corporate underwriting to activate,\u00a0Operation Prevention\u00a0is available for use today in every school, afterschool and community-based program in the United States. A comprehensive youth initiative,\u00a0Operation Prevention\u00a0combines\u00a0virtual field trips,\u00a0parent resources, digital tools, and a nationwide peer-to-peer\u00a0video challenge\u00a0that encourages teens to create 30-60 second original public service announcements (PSAs). The PSAs are designed to engage students in life-saving conversations about the science of addiction.The DEA tapped Discovery Education to help activate\u00a0Operation Prevention\u00a0in local communities through the\u00a0Discovery Education Community, the largest professional learning community of its kind. In addition,\u00a0Operation Prevention\u00a0is also accessible through Discovery Education\u2019s Streaming services.\u201cToday marks an important\u00a0milestone in the work of\u00a0Operation Prevention\u00a0as we join forces with the Milken Institute, and leading education and business advocacy organizations, to further ignite lifesaving\u00a0conversations in classrooms and\u00a0communities nationwide,\"\u00a0said\u00a0Lori McFarling, senior vice president and chief marketing officer, Discovery Education. \"We are proud to have been selected as the DEA's national\u00a0education partner and look forward to collaborating with the organizations announced today, and others\u00a0in the weeks ahead, to reach every student, every classroom, and\u00a0every community, as we endeavor to eliminate\u00a0opioid\u00a0misuse in our country.\"According to the 2017 National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH), there were 11.8 million people aged 12 or older who misused opioids in the past year. More than 11 million pain reliever misusers and 948,000 heroin users have been impacted by the epidemic, and one in five teens say they have used prescription medicine at least once in their lifetime to get high.Discovery Communications, parent company of Discovery Education, announced today it will airOperation Prevention\u00a0PSAs across its national networks to further magnify the importance of understanding the dangers of prescription drug abuse.In addition, the following organizations have committed to joining\u00a0Operation Prevention\u2019s\u00a0efforts to help initiate life-saving conversations about drug-free living:Afterschool Alliance:\u00a0The Afterschool Alliance is a nonprofit public awareness and advocacy organization working to ensure that all children and youth have access to quality afterschool programs.
