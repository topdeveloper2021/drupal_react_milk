Tanisha Carino Throughout her distinguished career, Dr. Carino has been at the forefront of collaborative efforts to promote policies, research, and business practices that support the fight against disease and improve the lives of patients. She most recently led the U.S. policy function for GlaxoSmithKline, a U.K.-based science-led global healthcare company. Prior to her role at GlaxoSmithKline, she spent more than a decade with Avalere Health, where, among other responsibilities, she founded the Center on Evidence Based Medicine and worked with patients, government, and senior leaders at Fortune 500 companies to maximize opportunities and mitigate challenges related to biomedical research and patient access. Prior to Avalere, Dr. Carino worked in the Medicare program to improve access for its beneficiaries and support the development of real-world evidence. \u201cSpeeding up and improving the medical research system is essential to achieving the social and economic potential we have as a society and as individuals,\u201d said Dr. Carino. \u201cFasterCures has been a leader in bringing all stakeholders together to fulfill this vision of saving lives, by saving time. I am honored to join a devoted group of colleagues and fellows in leading this effort to eliminate roadblocks and spur innovation, collaboration, and patient engagement.\u201d Dr. Carino earned her Ph.D. in health policy from Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore and is associate faculty at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.

Her research was published in the volume Health Care Coverage Determinations: An International Comparative Study. Since then, she has been widely published on topics that include patient engagement and paying for cures. She holds a B.A. in sociology from Emory University in Atlanta. \u201cNew technologies provide science with an extraordinary opportunity for advances against disease, yet that progress often encounters an ecosystem that can stall getting cures to patients,\" said Richard Ditizio, president of the Milken Institute. \"Dr. Carino has worked across the medical research continuum and offers a unique leadership perspective as FasterCures continues its impactful work on behalf of patients everywhere. We are delighted that she is bringing her energy and expertise to this critical mission.\u201d Dr. Carino\u2019s appointment builds on the Milken Institute\u2019s broad-based work to improve health.
