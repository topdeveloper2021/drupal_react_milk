The project is sponsored by IBM, Invitrogen, Affymetrix, and Bioaccelerate. \"BioBank Central will promote and facilitate collaboration and discovery in the scientific community,\" said FasterCures President Greg Simon. \"And it will provide patients and their families with information about how they can accelerate the development of new cures for diseases by donating blood and tissue for medical research.\" \"BioBank Central is unique in the breadth of constituencies that it addresses: the scientific, clinical, and patient communities, the hospital and academic sector, policy-makers and the public,\" Simon continued. \"Since biobanks are a key resource for the emergence of genomic medicine, this is indeed an area where collaborations among all stakeholders in the community are essential.\" Comprised of large numbers of high-quality biospecimens supplemented with clinical data, biobanks - also called biorepositories or tissue banks - can harness the power of both genomic and clinical information and serve as a bridge between basic and applied research. As science and technology leaders work to address the many challenges facing U.S. biobanks - logistical, technical, ethical, financial, intellectual property, and IT - BioBank Central will serve as an accurate and timely source of knowledge and news about biorepositories and their role in research and drug development. It will also link researchers with resources, encourage the donation of specimens, educate the public about the advancements that could come from the study of biological materials, accelerate the discovery and development of new diagnostics and therapeutics and enable the biorepository community to collaborate on implementing best practices and promising approaches to advance the field. The web site, to be built in partnership with Feinstein Kean Healthcare, based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, will provide a working group venue, patient and public education programs, an international collaboration component and serve as a forum for debate. The portal will be available for use in coming weeks. <b>About IBM Healthcare & Life Sciences:<\/b><b> IBM is the world's largest information technology company, with more than 80 years of leadership in helping businesses innovate.
