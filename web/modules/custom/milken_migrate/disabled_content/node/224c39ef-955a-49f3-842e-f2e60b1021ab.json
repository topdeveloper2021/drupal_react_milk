Tech titan San Francisco claimed the top spot, up two ranks from last year. Last year\u2019s No. 1, Austin, Texas, dropped a slot. The rest of the top five boast thriving tech sectors as well: Provo, Utah (third, down from second last year); San Jose, Calif. (unchanged at fourth); and Raleigh, N.C.

Austin, Provo, and Boulder, Colo., are examples. \u201cThese tech centers have a high employment multiplier,\u201d notes DeVol. \u201cThat is, one tech position generates nearly four other jobs.\u201dEven with recent declines in the price of oil and natural gas, advances in horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing are changing the U.S. energy landscape. That\u2019s lifted the economies of many cities, including Houston, the leading center of North American energy, which rose one rank to No. 7. Smaller cities such as Fargo, N. D. (the top U.S. small metro), and Victoria, Texas, continued to benefit from the shale boom. But the report warns that oil prices below $70 per barrel will moderate future advances.Other highlights from \u201cBest-Performing Cities 2014: Where America\u2019s Jobs Are Created and Sustained\u201d include:San Francisco achieved the top rank for the first time in the 15-year history of the index. Propelling the gains: the city\u2019s No. 1 finish in wage growth over both the past five-year and one-year periods. \u201cYoung, technology-skilled workers are flocking to San Francisco, driving up wages and driving down unemployment in these sectors below 2 percent,\u201d says DeVol.Texas is still a jobs machine, claiming five of the top 10 positions among large metros. A special Texas blend of tech, energy strength, and a favorable business climate revved up these urban economies.\nTechnology centers captured 13 of the top 25, with metros containing both creative- and scientific-based industries performing best.\n\u201c2014 was a banner year for employment growth in the United States.
