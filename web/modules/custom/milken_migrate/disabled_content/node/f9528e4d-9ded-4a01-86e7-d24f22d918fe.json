That's one of the conclusions of a sweeping research report released today by the Milken Institute, \"A Matter of Degrees: the Effect of Educational Attainment on Regional Economic Prosperity.<br>?Ross DeVol, chief research officer and one of the report authors, explains: \"Our research makes a compelling case that for America's communities, the returns to investment from higher education have never been greater.

Institute economists created a unique data set linking educational attainment and occupational trends over time and by region. The report and the accompanying data site not only provide a blueprint for policy makers and leaders to boost education: they can help career seekers figure out where they can get the most bang from their educational buck.Key findings of the study include:\u2022 Education increases regional prosperity. Adding one year to the average years of schooling among the employed in a metropolitan area is associated with an increase of real GDP per capita of more than ten percent, and an increase in real wages per worker of more than eight percent.<br> \u2022 Better educated = bigger benefits.
