And I think the science shows that that perception is incorrect.We know two things now that address your question. The first is that Alzheimer\u2019s starts about two decades before a person develops symptoms. During that period of 20 years, you\u2019re losing brain cells, and you\u2019re losing brain connectivity. If you can detect the disease at the very start, particularly before you lose enough brain cells to become symptomatic, we may have the ability to stop the process or at least slow it down and prevent an individual from becoming symptomatic.If one is developing Alzheimer\u2019s in their 50s and 60s, they are going to become symptomatic in their 70s and 80s. If you can slow the overall process and have people become symptomatic in their late 90s or 100s, you have the ability to essentially prevent the disease from being symptomatic in most of our lifetimes. That\u2019s really the major reason to move towards early detection, because preventing brain loss is a lot easier than restoring brain cells once they\u2019ve died.The other reason people should be interested is that even though we don\u2019t have a pill that can stop the progression, we know that Alzheimer\u2019s also has a lifestyle component. The scientific evidence shows that lifestyle habits such as a Mediterranean diet, exercise, sleep, meditation, and other types of mindfulness modify stress levels. We\u2019re seeing that potentially even micronutrients like the omega-3 fish oils may be very important in slowing the progression of Alzheimer\u2019s disease.<b>What\u2019s your take on Pfizer\u00a0ending\u00a0research to find new drugs aimed at treating Alzheimer's and Parkinson\u2019s disease? How do you think it will impact ongoing research?<\/b>I think a lot of the trials that have failed for Alzheimer\u2019s disease, including the Pfizer trial, could\u2019ve been better designed and better developed. I think we have a lot to learn from the failure of those trials.For example, how do we get the drugs into the brain more effectively?
