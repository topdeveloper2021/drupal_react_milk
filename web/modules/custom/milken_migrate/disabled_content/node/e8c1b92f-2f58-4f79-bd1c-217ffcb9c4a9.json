Just maybe. The 57th annual Grammy Awards show is a case in point. Who would have expected music\u2019s fresh outlook on older artists and intergenerational collaboration? The Grammy\u2019s featured powerhouse teams like Eurythmics\u2019 veteran Annie Lennox and Hozier, a millennial sensation. Tony Bennett was paired with Lady Gaga and Jessie J performed with Tom Jones. Paul McCartney formed a trio with Rihanna and Kanye West.

The widely praised documentary, \u201cKeep On Keepin\u2019 On,\u201d is the story of the late, great jazz trumpeter Clark Terry\u2019s mentorship of blind piano prodigy Justin Kauflin as Terry\u2019s young prot\u00e9g\u00e9 prepares for an international competition.

Hopefully, more such films are on the way. As the U.S. and countries across the world confront a massive demographic shift resulting from lower birthrates and increasing longevity, there\u2019s an opportunity for new thinking about purposefully engaging older adults. Research demonstrates the value of intergenerational relationships for older and younger people \u2013 and for effectiveness. The creativity and innovation can inspire. The energy, learning and mentorship flow both ways. If older adults can be recognized for their value and intergenerational models can work so well in entertainment, they can certainly work in technology, manufacturing, health care, financial services, education and other domains. Not all older adults have the vitality of the 70-something Stones (it turns out it wasn\u2019t such a drag for them to get old). But an emerging message from the entertainment industry is worth consideration. Presented with opportunity, older adults can continue to contribute successfully, and both young and old can benefit from enhanced understanding about the power of intergenerational engagement.
