For the past six years, FasterCures has analyzed the barriers to medical progress and developed innovative programs to address them, such as: the Philanthropy Advisory Service, an online information marketplace designed to make philanthropic investment in medical research more effective and productive; TRAIN (The Research Acceleration and Innovation Network), established to create opportunities for medical research innovators to discuss and tackle the challenges that cut across diseases; and PHD (Patients Helping Doctors), an effort aimed to empower patients to contribute to medical research. \"By accelerating the process of medical research, the work of FasterCures is bringing improved treatment outcomes for people everywhere. That effort will produce more lifesaving cures,\" said Michael Milken, chairman of FasterCures. FasterCures, a center of the Milken Institute, is an \"action\" tank committed to saving lives by saving time in the research, discovery and development of new treatments for deadly and debilitating diseases.
