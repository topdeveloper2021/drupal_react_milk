The question is, how can they prepare for a post-fossil fuel era? In a new book, Agile Energy Systems, Global Lessons from the California Energy Crisis, authors Woodrow W. Clark II, a senior fellow at the Milken Institute, and Ted K.

The key to this new \"paradigm,\" Clark and Bradshaw say, is to diversify fuel sources. Using the California electricity crisis of 2000-2001 as the prime example of an energy supply system gone wrong, the authors provide not only a litany of reasons why the current deregulated system isn\u2032t working, but why an \"agile energy system\" - one that replaces the old vertically integrated regulated utility with one based on renewable energy generation and hybrid or combined technologies - will supply us with a constant, efficient supply of energy while reducing our dependence on fossil fuels. \"This book is a promissory note for a global clean energy future,\" says Jeremy Rifkin, founder and president of the Foundation on Economic Trends. \"It defines what the practical world of energy is today and can be in the future.\"\nAgile Energy Systems, part of publisher Elservier\u2032s Global Energy Policy and Economics Series, is divided into three sections.
