    "value": "The aging Baby Boom generation, generally believed to be the Godzilla that will ravage the economy when its members retire, may have a kinder, gentler side. Brad Edmondson, the former editor of American Demographics magazine, writes in the latest issue of The Milken Institute Review that while the U.S. population is aging, \"the way it ages may turn out far less costly than has been so widely assumed.\" With changes in diet, habits and medical care, many aging Baby Boomers are expected to live far healthier and more productive lives than previously anticipated, Edmondson says. Studies already show, for instance, that disability is declining faster than longevity is increasing. \"People like me are paid to say impressive things like 'demography is destiny,\u2032 but that isn\u2032t always true,\" Edmondson writes. \"Every so often, discontinuities in economics, technology and politics converge to alter conditions for millions of individuals in a brief span of time, leaving demographers with egg of their faces.\" Also in this issue of the Institute\u2032s quarterly journal of economic policy, Ian Parry, a senior fellow at the Washington, D.C.-based Resources for the Future, looks at a recurring idea for weaning us from oil\u2032s grip: increase taxes on gasoline. Parry argues that this approach will actually do little to solve the myriad problems of pollution, congestion and geopolitical security linked to America\u2032s huge appetite for oil. \"Vehicle fuel taxes offer little chance for progress with respect to climate change and oil dependence,\" he writes. \"Indeed, they are a diversion from what might work - namely, broad-based carbon emissions deterrence and technological change that reduces demand for hydrocarbon fuels.\" Other highlights from the new Review: Two scholars debate the value of expanding pre-school education to all children. Lynn Karoly, a senior economist at the RAND Corporation, says the return on such an investment will far outweigh the costs.
