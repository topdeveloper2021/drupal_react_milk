The bill will now be sent to the White House. In last Saturday\u2019s weekly address, President Barack Obama said that he would sign the bill into law as soon as it reaches his desk, enacting $4.8 billion of new funding for the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and $500 million for the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), as well as a comprehensive suite of policy provisions that will strengthen the entire biomedical innovation system.\u201cThis landmark legislation will accelerate cures for many life-threatening diseases and help advance precision medicine,\u201d said Michael Milken, chairman of the Milken Institute. \u201cIt assures patient-focused drug development, adds rigor to clinical trials, expands compassionate use of new drugs by dying patients, speeds the review of vaccines, addresses antibiotic resistance, responds to the opioid crisis and strengthens the nation\u2019s research infrastructure.\u201d<i>FasterCures<\/i> has been honored to work with leaders in Congress, NIH and FDA throughout the bill\u2019s journey. This is the culmination of more than two years of hard work and dedication by the bill\u2019s bipartisan congressional champions and their staffs. House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Fred Upton and Representative Diana DeGette, with Ranking Member Frank Pallone, reached out to stakeholders throughout the medical research system to gather up the best ideas and translate them into legislation. Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Chairman Lamar Alexander and Ranking Member Patty Murray also championed the effort and moved a set of bipartisan bills through their committee.\u00a0As the bill moved toward votes on the floors of both chambers, strong commitment from Speaker Paul Ryan, Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy and Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi, in partnership with their Senate colleagues, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Democratic Leader Harry Reid, resulted in the overwhelmingly bipartisan votes we\u2019ve seen in the past few days. Improving the biomedical innovation system is truly something that all can agree on.\u00a0\u201cThe time for medical research progress is now. We are so pleased that Congress seized this opportunity and united around this strong legislation,\u201d said Margaret Anderson, executive director of <i>FasterCures<\/i>. \u201cThis act will invest in and strengthen the federal research system, which will support the United States\u2019 long-standing tradition of scientific progress and hopefully spur advances for the many patients who are desperately waiting for effective treatments and cures.\u201dThe 21st Century Cures legislation addresses the entire biomedical innovation system, and would support many of the recommendations from <i>FasterCures<\/i>\u2019 Rx for Innovation project.
