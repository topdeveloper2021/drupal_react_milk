The report includes commentary from participants at the 2017 Summit on Business and the Future of Aging, which brought together thought leaders from academia, media, business, health, public policy, and the nonprofit sector. The summit was convened in collaboration with the M Center of Excellence at The American College of Financial Services.\u00a0\u201cPopulation aging across the globe presents a great 21st-century challenge,\u201d explains Paul Irving, chairman of the Milken Institute Center for the Future of Aging, distinguished scholar in residence at the USC Davis School of Gerontology, and principal author of the report. \u201cBut the news is not all bad. In fact, the aging population may represent the world's most compelling business opportunity. As \u201cSilver to Gold\u201d reveals, older adults represent a massive and growing human capital resource and an attractive consumer market for innovative products and services.\u201dThe report offers thoughtful, fact-filled assessments of the growing economic power of older adults, the underutilized resource of mature workers, advances that can dramatically extend lifespan, health and productivity, and a call to action. Among the highlights shared:By the end of this decade, annual consumer spending by age 60-and-over adults globally will reach $15 trillion (Bank of America Merrill Lynch)Americans over 50 account for $7.6 trillion in direct spending and related economic activity (Oxford Economics\/AARP)\nOlder adults in the U.S. dominate 119 out of 123 consumer packaged-goods categories (Bank of America Merrill Lynch)\nMore Americans 65 and older are working than at any time since the turn of the century and spending more time on the job than did their peers in earlier years(Transamerica Institute)\nThe proportion of people in the working-age population worldwide who are 50 or older will grow from 20 percent in 2010 to 30 percent by 2050(The Boston Consulting Group)\nOlder workers in the U.S. have similar or lower injury and illness rates than younger counterparts (CDC)\nFewer than half of companies worldwide factor longevity into their strategic planning (The Economist)\n\u201cIn a world torn by policy and political divides, the leadership mantle is increasingly defaulting to the business community,\u201d the report concludes. \u201cCorporate leaders can speak out and advocate for the interests of older employees and customers, calling their colleagues and peers to action. It is time for 21st-century businesses to confront stereotypes that veil the market and human capital opportunities of population aging. They must embrace the promise and possibilities of a new mature world, align policies and practices with the interests of demographically changing customers and employees, and become advocates for public health and financial security.\u201dIn 2018, the Milken Institute Center for the Future of Aging will launch a new Business Council to mobilize efforts and address opportunities presented by population aging. The council, composed of senior executives in major national and multi-national companies, will develop shared principles, elevate best practices, and advance commitments across sectors to improve the lives of the current generation of older adults and of generations to come.\u201cAlthough ageist and outdated policies and practices can impede progress, there is hope,\u201d says Peter Mullin, chairman of the M Center of Excellence. \u201cThat hope comes from enlightened businesses ready to reach for the opportunities of a new age. By realizing the potential of older adults, they will serve the interests of all their stakeholders and create a better future.
