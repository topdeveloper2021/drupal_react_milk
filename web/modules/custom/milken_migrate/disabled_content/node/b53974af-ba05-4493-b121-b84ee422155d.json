These are some of America\u2032s biggest and oldest cities \u2014 places where other single, creative people live, and where they enjoy the arts, culture and other lifestyle amenities.\n\"The most salient reason for urban revival comes from the role our cities are playing in the enormous technological revolution now transforming the larger economy,\" says the report, written by Ross DeVol, Director of Regional and Demographic Studies at the Milken Institute, and Senior Fellow Joel Kotkin, two of this country\u2032s leading experts on the impact of high-tech on our economy and cities. \"Technology is reshaping the landscape of American communities.\"\nThe authors found that the cities that have done best in the current urban revival are New York, San Francisco, Boston, Los Angeles and Chicago.

These \"emerging technology\" cities provide the \"hard\" or support side of technology \u2014 manufacturing, services and supplies \u2014 with fewer of the drawbacks that trouble major high-tech communities: higher costs of business, traffic congestion, and so on. Examples of cities positioning themselves as \"emerging technology\" centers are Reno, Albuquerque, Tulsa, Huntsville, Omaha and Boise.\nThe most encouraging development of the digital age, however, may be the renaissance of some of America\u2032s most troubled urban neighborhoods.
