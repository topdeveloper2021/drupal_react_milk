The report, Biopharmaceutical Industry Contributions to State and U.S. Economies, says that several states - New Jersey, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, California and Maryland among them - are already in position to take advantage of this industry\u2032s economic development, while others - like Nevada, Vermont, Florida and West Virginia - are on the cusp of developing an important biopharmaceutical economy. \"Many cities and states are working hard to gain a share of the biopharmaceutical industry,\" said Ross DeVol, Director of Regional Economics at the Milken Institute and the report\u2032s principal author. \"And our research shows why: It\u2032s an important and growing part of the global knowledge-based economy that will have a very positive impact in those regions that are successful in growing these firms.\"\nAccording to the study, the biopharmaceutical industry is expected to employ more than 413,000 workers nationwide by the end of this year. By 2014, that number is expected to increase to more than 536,000 - an increase of 30 percent. In addition, real output (adjusted for inflation) is expected to rise from $69.2 billion this year to $128.3 billion in 2014, while workers\u2032 earnings are due to rise from $31.4 billion in 2004 to $56.6 billion in 10 years. Among the study\u2032s highlights: The industry was directly responsible for $63.9 billion in real output in 2003. When the additional dollars it generated in other industries through an economic \"ripple\" effect are accounted for, it was responsible for more than $174 billion.<b> The industry directly employed 406,700 workers in 2003.
