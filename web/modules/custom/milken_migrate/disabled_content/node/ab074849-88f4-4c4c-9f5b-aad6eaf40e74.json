Getting food to the most people with the fewest resources is a constant challenge for food-assistance agencies, but one that financial tools can help address, says a new report from the Milken Institute, <b>Feeding the World\u2032s Hungry: Fostering an Efficient and Responsive Food Access Pipeline<\/b>. \"High prices and worldwide recession have left more people than ever before without enough to eat, and the basic tools we\u2032re using to meet food assistance needs can\u2032t keep pace,\" said Betsy Zeidman, research fellow at the Milken Institute and lead author of the report. \"The financial tools suggested aren\u2032t unusual in themselves, but they would present an extraordinary shift toward making food assistance more efficient and responsive.\" The finance tools examined in the report have been used effectively in other sectors - for example, to provide vaccines to developing countries - but they have not been used in food assistance delivery. The report recommends using such instruments as call options, guaranteed bonds and tax credits to help improve assistance groups\u2032 ability to deliver desperately needed food on time and at lower cost. According to the report, the main challenges facing global food assistance organizations fall into three categories: funding, price and supply. Funding, which primarily comes from donations, is unpredictable. This unpredictability, combined with some donors\u2032 restrictions on the type of aid they can provide (i.e., in-kind or cash) and where their donations may be used, severely constrains organizations\u2032 planning and budgeting. The uncertainty also prevents them from taking advantage of economies of scale or stocking up on supplies when prices are low. Volatile prices and long and difficult transportation routes, trade barriers and security concerns also make it difficult for food assistance to reach those in need. To help break through these barriers, the report recommends a number of finance tools, including:<b> <b>Issue food assistance bonds backed by donor commitments<\/b>. These are legally binding donor pledges that could be securitized in capital markets, allowing organizations to access the funding when needed instead of waiting for the next donation to arrive.<b>\n<b>Make purchases in advance<\/b>. Unpredictable funding, among other factors, often forces groups to make spot purchases of supplies. But forward purchases, completed before the supplies are needed, allow organizations to lock in lower prices and offer them more flexibility on volume and delivery locations. <b>\n<b>Use call option contracts<\/b>. These would give assistance groups the right, but not the obligation, to buy supplies at a certain price for a certain period of time, allowing the organizations to optimize their donor dollars.<b>\n<b>Explore the increased use of public-sector grain reserves<\/b>. Greater use of locally held grain reserves would dramatically improve response times but must be planned and coordinated carefully to avoid disrupting local markets or discouraging private-sector reserves.<b>\n<b>Arrange tax credits for private-sector companies so that humanitarian organizations can tap their food stocks at the tax-free price<\/b>. Private-sector tax credits could increase available food supplies and enhance flexibility in sourcing and distribution. The report notes the critical need and timeliness for addressing this issue now: \"Ultimately, the solutions recommended in the report would allow humanitarian organizations to deliver food to developing countries on time and at a lower cost. Making operations more efficient will increase the number of people who receive food assistance and will limit hunger\u2032s long-term negative impact on developing countries\u2032 economic development.\" The report is the result of a Financial Innovations Lab, hosted by the Milken Institute with support from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, which took place in Washington, D.C., in July. The participants included humanitarian and government agencies and experts from international development finance institutions, commodity exchanges, banks, foundations and research organizations.\nFinancial Innovations Labs are part of the Milken Institute\u2032s continuing leadership in promoting financial innovations to help solve ongoing social, economic and environmental challenges.
