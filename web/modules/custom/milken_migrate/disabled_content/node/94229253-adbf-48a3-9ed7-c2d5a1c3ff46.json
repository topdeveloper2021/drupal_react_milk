    "value": "In an effort to boost Israel\u2032s struggling economy, the Milken Institute has proposed a major economic initiative focused on that country\u2032s small-business sector. If successful, the Israel Entrepreneurial Finance Initiative will provided much-needed financial, technical, government and philanthropic support to Israel\u2032s small-business owners, the only sector to have created new jobs in Israel in the last decade despite such challenges as the Intifada and a severe credit crunch. (Small firms represent 97 percent of all Israeli businesses, yet receive less than 5 percent of total bank credit.) \"If we can increase the flow of capital available to these entrepreneurs, and give them the expertise they need to grow and sustain their businesses, it will create many new jobs and help the overall economy,\" said Glenn Yago, Director of Capital Studies at the Milken Institute. Yago will lead the endeavor. The Initiative, the first effort to comprehensively engage the public, private and philanthropic sectors to address the challenges facing these firms, will develop and pilot sustainable models for microenterprise and small-business development and growth by focusing on five areas: Targeted microfinance and small-business training and loan funds; <br> An entrepreneurial financial network and business-school extension services;<br> A robust, independent and credible small-business database;<br> Public policy and program innovations, such as the securitization of small-business loans, to dramatically increase the flow of capital to small businesses; <br> A web site to provide information on the Initiative, and engage a broad coalition.<br> A report released today outlines the Initiative\u2032s goals and says that Israel faces a major challenge to its economic growth. Among the barriers: a recent recession, the technology market crash, a credit crunch, high unemployment, high concentration of bank ownership, failed government initiatives in small-business finance, the Intifada, the underdevelopment of local equity and bond markets and the overweighting of large firms over small ones in bank loan portfolios (1 percent of Israel\u2032s largest companies receive 71 percent of available credit). Israel\u2032s small-business owners also face such other problems as relatively high fixed costs for small-loan evaluation and the requirement by banks for 100 percent collateral, which few small-firm entrepreneurs can meet. In addition, few of the government\u2032s fragmented attempts to help these companies have yielded results, the Institute found. \"All these factors have converged to threaten surviving small businesses, start-ups and self-employment, and thus hinder economic prosperity for the self-employed and small-business owners,\" says the report, Building Israel\u2032s Small Business and Microenterprise Sector. The research was initiated and funded by the Saban Family Foundation, which has been interested in fostering microfinance in Israel as a way of bolstering the economy. The Institute was selected because of its highly regarded research in creating and leveraging financial tools to help small businesses, and its long involvement in helping the Israeli government move to a more market-based economy. In developing recommendations for the Initiative, Institute scholars researched current conditions in Israel, interviewed experts in the business, financial, government and philanthropic communities, held roundtable discussions and reviewed products and services serving similar populations around the world. They learned several important lessons, among them: 1) The most successful programs aimed at these businesses are flexible enough to be adaptable to local needs, but standardized enough to keep costs under control. <br>\n2) Leverage is essential - from leveraging human and intellectual capital to provide technical assistance to leveraging financial capital to increase the funds available to these enterprises. The Initiative recommends pledging philanthropic funds for not only grant support, but also loan guarantees that will reduce risk to lenders and leverage significant additional private capital to these entrepreneurs. It further recommends using funds to target microenterprises, minorities, women and unemployed youth, who have suffered high levels of economic distress, unemployment and poverty and who have difficulty gaining access to capital. \"It is apparent that an innovative program increasing the supply of financial and human capital to the small-business sector is long overdue,\" says the report. \"The number of businesses that could be impacted by the program, and the number of jobs created or preserved, would boost the Israeli economy.\"\nRead report (pdf).",
