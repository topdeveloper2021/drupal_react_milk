    "value": "Washington, D.C. - The federal government should move forward with housing finance reform as soon as possible, including allowing other mortgage finance-related companies to compete with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac on a level playing field and selling Fannie and Freddie back into private hands. Private capital would then stand in front of a secondary government guarantee on mortgage-backed securities, according to \"Reform of the GSEs and Housing Finance,\" a white paper released today by the Milken Institute.\nThe goals of the proposal in the white paper are to ensure that Americans have access to mortgages in all market conditions, while making private capital the dominant funding source for housing and protecting taxpayers from a repeat of the $150 billion rescue of the two government-sponsored firms during the financial crisis. The paper was written by Milken Institute Senior Fellow Phillip Swagel, a professor at the University of Maryland School of Public Policy and former senior official at the U.S. Treasury during the financial crisis. \"While government guarantees of mortgages are needed for the foreseeable future to ensure that Americans can obtain mortgages at reasonable rates, housing finance reform must be done in way that protects taxpayers against future bailouts,\" Swagel said. The proposal in the paper is consistent with the options being considered by the Treasury Department for reforming the mortgage finance system. <b>Sell Fannie and Freddie<BR><\/b>\nReturning Fannie and Freddie to private hands and allowing other firms to compete with them will foster an innovative housing finance system for the benefit of American homeowners. \"Competition will best drive innovation and ensure that the benefits of government involvement in housing go to homebuyers in the form of lower interest rates,\" Swagel wrote. <b>Standardize Mortgage-Backed Securities<BR><\/b>\nStandardizing the instruments involved in securitization to create a common form of MBS would be a helpful step in the transition to a better housing finance system.
