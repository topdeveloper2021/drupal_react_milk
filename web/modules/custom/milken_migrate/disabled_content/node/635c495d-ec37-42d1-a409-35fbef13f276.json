Committee members will serve as thought partners and provide guidance on independent research examining the role and value of FinTech in the financial services ecosystem and responsible policy and regulatory regimes that balance financial innovation and consumer protection.<b>Tom Curry\u00a0<\/b>(pictured below, left),\u00a0the former U.S. Comptroller of the Currency, chairs the committee.\u00a0<b>Melissa<\/b> <b>Koide\u00a0<\/b>(center),\u00a0a senior advisor at the Milken Institute, current\u00a0CEO of FinRegLab, and a former deputy assistant secretary for consumer policy at the U.S. Treasury Department under the Obama Administration, serves as vice-chair.The formation of the advisory committee is part of the Institute\u2019s effort to enhance its FinTech program. It focuses on two key themes: 1) informing lawmakers and regulators in the U.S. and abroad on approaches to innovations within the financial services sector and; 2) seeking to change the current focus beyond the technology platforms employ to how startups and incumbents are leveraging that technology to address financial inclusion, access to capital, transparency, and compliance.\u201cBanking and finance are not static businesses and must be allowed to evolve. The ability to adapt to meet the changing needs of customers and the marketplace is as critical today as it was 50 or 100 years ago. Simultaneously, we must also be able to responsibly innovate in order to take advantage of the large wave of progress quickly coming our way,\u201d said Curry, currently a partner at the law firm\u00a0Nutter\u00a0and co-leader of the firm\u2019s Banking and Financial Services group. \u201cNow that online lending and payments technologies are increasingly widespread, we must determine \u2018what\u2019s next?\u2019 and that\u2019s exactly where the FinTech Advisory Committee comes in.\u201dSince its launch in 2014, the Milken Institute FinTech program has been at the forefront of examining how government and industry should address financial innovations.
