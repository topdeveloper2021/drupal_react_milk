California\u2014as the world\u2019s eighth-largest economy and the main gateway between the United States and China\u2014has been a key beneficiary of this growth. Today, China is not only a major market for exports and source of imports for the state, but it has grown into one of California\u2019s leading international investors. Foreign direct investment in the state has soared from less than $100 million in 2005 to more than $9 billion in 2015.A new report from the Milken Institute\u2019s California Center\u2014\u201cA Golden Opportunity with China: How California Can Become an Even Bigger Destination for Chinese Foreign Investment\u201d\u2014outlines the crucial economic sectors involved in this investment and how they can maximize the benefit to both California and China.\u201cChina plays an increasingly important role in California\u2019s economic future,\u201d says report co-author Kevin Klowden, Executive Director of the California Center and Managing Economist at the Milken Institute. \u201cOur report examines where the relationship is strongest, and we discuss how policy and business leaders can grow the relationship, bringing further investment and jobs into California.\u201d\u00a0For much of the past three decades, Chinese investment abroad had focused on developing regions to satisfy China\u2019s expanding demand for raw materials. Recently, the foreign investment focus has been toward technology, real estate, and agriculture in Europe and the United States. While the proportion of Chinese foreign direct investment in the United States is marginal, California\u2019s share is not: The Golden State received more than 20 percent of Chinese FDI in the U.S. Although capital flows into residential properties from foreign sources are a concern since they affect already-high housing prices, foreign investment fuels jobs and overall growth. As of 2014, Chinese-affiliated firms in the U.S. employed more than 80,000 people, paying on average $85,000 in wages and benefits, far more than other foreign firms.The report identifies sectors in California that should be supported in building economic ties with China.These include:Trade promotion and financing. As California exporters strive to reach China\u2019s growing middle class, it will be essential to facilitate the growth of exports by small and medium-size businesses. Chinese as well as California leaders should promote the education of new potential exporters and connect them with mechanisms to reduce their risk through trade financing and insurance.Infrastructure.
