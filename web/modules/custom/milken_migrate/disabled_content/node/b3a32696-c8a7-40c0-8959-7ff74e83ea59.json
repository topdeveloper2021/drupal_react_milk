According to a new report by the Milken Institute, <b>The Value of U.S. Life Sciences: A White Paper Exploring Competitiveness, Delivery and Challenges<\/b>, the sector can serve as a model for other U.S. industries. The life sciences sector has been successful at building and sustaining the centers of research, development and manufacturing that make the U.S. an unrivaled leader in absolute number of biotech patents in the world. The U.S. life sciences industry has earned seven times the number of biotech patents as the next nine countries combined. The Milken Institute analysis looks at the life sciences industry as a whole, comprising biotechnology, pharmaceuticals, medical devices, life sciences R&D, and healthcare services. The report notes that certain parts of the industry have come under fire - often based on misunderstanding of the drivers of health care cost - as businesses, government and individuals seek to address rising healthcare costs. \"Health care costs are indeed rising, but the life sciences industry has a tremendous role in both developing cutting-edge treatments and providing proactive strategies that can dramatically decrease the costs of chronic disease,\" said Ross DeVol, Director of Health Economics at the Milken Institute and author of the report. As the report notes, the high rates of chronic disease in the U.S. are not only driving the rapid rise of healthcare costs, but they are eroding productivity and overall GDP. The report recommends creative partnerships between health science businesses and other businesses to address the underlying factors associated with chronic disease to increase productivity and lower treatment costs. \"If the business community were to partner aggressively with the life sciences industry to focus squarely on an ambitious goal of reducing the most common chronic diseases, the results could include significant cost savings, higher productivity, and reduced human suffering,\" states the report. Higher obesity rates in the U.S., compared to other advanced economies, explain much of the greater prevalence of chronic diseases, which are driving healthcare costs higher. While the private sector drives a significant amount of the R&D process in the U.S., there is also a competitive advantage from the activity taking place at universities. Unlike in other nations, the U.S. has a decentralized funding system for R&D at the universities, fostering competition and cross-disciplinary collaborations. Singapore\u2032s model is to push entrepreneurship from the government, while the European model depends on a centralized financing system. The technology-transfer process in the U.S. is also strong, compared to other nations. As more universities invest in strong tech-transfer departments, the clusters around these knowledge centers can attract and sustain a wide variety of local and regional businesses, both small and medium-size enterprises in life sciences as well as ancillary supportive goods and services, such as hospitality, housing and retail. Life science enterprises thus serve as the hub of local development in a variety of sectors. Another key advantage for the U.S. is the sector\u2032s appeal to venture capitalists, both domestic and foreign. According to the report, the biotechnology industry raised more than $20 billion in dept and equity capital in 2004. This is a critical part of building sustainable clusters, given the role that risk capital and entrepreneurs play in developing new ideas, products and services for this dynamic sector. The report also provides key metrics and maps out the successes and challenges facing the key hubs of life sciences in the U.S., including Boston, San Diego, Philadelphia, Raleigh-Durham and others. <b>The Value of U.S. Life Sciences: A White Paper Exploring Competitiveness, Delivery and Challenge, <b>is available here.",
