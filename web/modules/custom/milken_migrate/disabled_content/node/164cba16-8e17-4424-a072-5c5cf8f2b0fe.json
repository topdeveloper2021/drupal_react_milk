The Index will provide updated measurements of the technology and science assets for all 50 states. It will also include a ranking of the states based on their ability to foster and sustain a technology sector, which the Institute's research has shown is a crucial factor in determining a region's future economic success. The release will include a national report and a separate, more in-depth study of California's technology assets. The index, last released in 2004, is one of the most comprehensive examinations of state technology and science assets ever undertaken. The states are ranked on dozens of measurements - from higher education to access to venture capital - in five categories: research and development, risk capital and entrepreneurial infrastructure; human capital investment, technology and science workforce, and technology concentration and dynamism. Ross DeVol, Director of Regional Economics, will present the findings at the press conference, which will also include remarks from Maryland Gov. Martin O\u2032Malley, whose state ranks high on the new index. Four years ago, Massachusetts topped the index, followed by California, Colorado, Maryland and Virginia. Following the 9 a.m. press conference, the full rankings and complete reports will be available on the Institute\u2032s web site.",
