It's way past time, argues <b>Severin Borenstein<\/b>, director of the University of California Energy Institute, to get a grip on the realities of our narrowing options. \"There is little that the United States could do on its own to drive down the price of oil,\" Borenstein writes in the latest Milken Institute Review (4th Quarter 2008). \"But there is much we could do to minimize the risks created by heavy dependence on petroleum. A good place to start is to drop the rhetoric of energy independence and focus on the appropriate, more achievable goal of energy security.\" Also in this issue: - <b>Julia Isaacs<\/b> and <b>Belle Sawhill<\/b> of the Brookings Institution take on the myth that America is the land of opportunity. \"Americans, fortuitously, seem to care more about fairness - equality of opportunity - than about equality of outcomes,\" they point out. \"But America doesn't do particularly well on this score: class-ridden 'old Europe' does better on critical measures.\" - <b>Nicholas Eberstadt<\/b> of the American Enterprise Institute calls for abandoning the \"official poverty rate.\" \"While the OPR numbers say that the proportion of the American population living in poverty has changed little - indeed, has slightly increased - since the early 1970s, data on household spending show substantial and continuing growth in consumption among those reporting very low incomes. Indeed, it is becoming increasingly clear that the OPR is of no help in figuring where we are today or even where we've come from.\" - <b>Ray Kopp<\/b> of Resources for the Future offers a no-tears guide to the coming battle over climate change legislation. \"The die is cast; our planet is going to get warmer,\" he writes. \"But the decisions we make - or don't make - will determine how fast and how hot it will get. Both presidential candidates are committed to a serious effort to slow the rate of climate change. However, the success of any program will require good policy choices in the teeth of public skepticism and well-organized interest-group opposition.\" - <b>Roger D.
