We found that the only time we could get coverage for our work was when we were, in some way, reinforcing ageist stereotypes. We felt we needed an alternative platform that could accurately reflect our point of view. Collaboration is an important virtue for us, so we decided from the start that this would be a shared platform that would give voice to a wide range of people who want to change aging.

People are supposed to \u201cage in place\u201d but then must occupy houses that were built for raising children but are bad for aging with independence. We work with what we call the \u201ctriple alloy\u201d of architecture, culture, and technology. Minka exists to synthesize these three domains and use that synthesis to generate a whole new generation of independence-oriented solutions. Our houses are intended to be the building blocks around which these new models can coalesce.

I think the buildings will survive, mostly repurposed for \u201chigher\u201d levels of care. The people will survive and find new ways of living and working. The policies will change, and the money that currently fuels the system will be exhausted. In the long run, skilled nursing facilities will be seen as a fascinating social-cultural experiment, and many Ph.D. theses will be written about the history. Older people will find and create clever new ways of protecting and extending independence. <b>What lessons have you learned since you began your mission of reforming long-term care?\u00a0<\/b> Patience is a virtue.

All innovations are held to a de minimis financial model derived from an institutional model that many older people fear more than death. This constraint creates a powerful \u201clock in\u201d advantage for existing facilities and services. The low expectations generated by our culture\u2019s pervasive ageism are part of a self-stoking cycle in which those expectations normalize poor outcomes that then reinforce low expectations.
