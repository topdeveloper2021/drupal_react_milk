In a recently released research report by the Milken Institute, \u201cRecapturing the Taiwan Miracle: Diversifying the Economy through Innovation and Collaboration,\u201d researchers propose stronger public private partnerships in three key areas to re-energize businesses, revitalize the economy and reclaim the Taiwan miracle.\u201cTaiwan was once a growth miracle for the region, but since the 2000\u2019s the economy has lagged. Exports have declined 16 months consecutively,\u201d said Perry Wong, managing director of research at the Milken Institute and author of the report. \u201cWe undertook this research to find out why, and how the economy can gain a second wind.\u201dClose cooperation between the public and private sectors in crafting diversified development strategies will enable Taiwan to free itself from its current economic struggle, the report concludes. Taiwan has fallen behind its Tiger counterparts due to overreliance on the high-tech industry and original equipment manufacturing (OEM), which has been suffering thanks to shrinking global demand. At the same time, unattractive policies have diverted both foreign capital and human capital to neighboring countries. According to Oxford Economics, Taiwan will face a severe talent shortage by 2021. The report details three key areas in which the public and private sector can collaborate:Research and development (R&D) and innovation: While President Tsai Ing-Wen\u2019s party is targeting key industries for the future, such as biotechnology, defense and the Internet of Things (IoT), other private businesses in Taiwan can invest in their own R&D and innovation to provide higher quality and high value-added products and services. The authors see great potential for Taiwan\u2019s high-end service industry to become another economic growth engine. The report points out that the government can facilitate R&D and innovation through policy and financial tools, as well as by nurturing knowledge partnerships between domestic and oversea professionals in the public, private and academic sectors. Branding and marketing: Diversifying into new markets and improving after-sales services would expand the customer base of many Taiwanese companies that are currently limited to markets sharing a similar language and culture. Along with improved quality products, highly reliable services and a maturing intellectual property rights protection, Taiwan can build a strong, global brand in the advanced-services industry.\nAttracting foreign investment and human capital: The report recommends reforming institutions and policies with better incentives to attract and retain foreign investment and talent. Taiwan\u2019s brain drain often is attributed to the gap between its higher education system and the employment needs of businesses, as well as its stagnant wages. As raising wages will be difficult in the short run, the government should propose more effective immigration policies that allow foreign talents to work and live in Taiwan.\n\u201cWhile the public sector has a broader economic view and controls policy and regulatory tools, private businesses have a better understanding of market dynamics and can quickly adapt to global market shifts,\u201d said Dr. Michael Lin, research analyst at the institute and co-author. \u201cWith constant interaction, Taiwan can restructure its industrial policies and regulations to capture the latest economic dynamics in a timely manner and reclaim the Taiwan miracle.\u201d\u201cRecapturing the Taiwan Miracle: Diversifying the Economy through Innovation and Collaboration\u201d by Michael C.Y.
