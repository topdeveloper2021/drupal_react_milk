But beyond security issues, a transition to stability and democracy depends on success in rebuilding the economy. And here, the legacy of American policy could prove very damaging, according to an economist writing in the latest Milken Institute Review. As described by <b>Robert Looney<\/b> of the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, Calif., efforts to bring free markets and prosperity to Iraq have gotten off to a rocky start. \"Iraq\u2032s current economic malaise has its origins in a series of miscalculations by the Coalition Provisional Authority,\" he writes. \"Too many decisions were made without examining the economic dimension.\" Despite these challenges, however, Iraq\u2032s interim government has put many important reforms in place that could lead to economic growth - once the country gets some \"breathing room\" from the violence. \"One hopes that improved security will bring more capital from abroad, stimulating reconstruction and job creation,\" Looney writes. \"Accordingly, it is possible that growth and reform will fit into a virtuous circle, just as they did in the successful transition economies in Eastern Europe.\" Also in the new Review, <b>Martin Bailey<\/b>, former chairman of President Clinton\u2032s Council of Economic Advisers, and <b>Diana Farrell<\/b>, head of the McKinsey Global Institute, offer a strong defense of one of the recent political season\u2032s hottest topics: outsourcing. \"Far from being a zero-sum game, offshoring is a story of mutual gain, benefiting both countries,\" they write. \"Far from being bad for the United States, offshoring creates net value for the economy - to the tune of $1.12 to $1.14 for every dollar that goes abroad.\" Other highlights from the 4th Quarter Review: <b>Bill Gale<\/b> of the Brookings Institution urges Washington to pay more attention to America\u2032s children. \"It\u2032s time to stop separating children\u2032s issues from other aspects of fiscal policy,\" he writes. \"We are passing on huge fiscal burdens to future generations, and, at the same time, doing a wretched job of equipping the most at-risk members of the next generation with the tools they need to cope in today\u2032s grab-it-while-you-can economy.\"<b> <b>Greg Rushford<\/b>, editor of The Rushford Report newsletter on international trade and finance, throws some cold water on Washington\u2032s enthusiasm for preferential trade agreements with individual countries. \"The preferential trade approach offers a double whammy, both distorting efficient trade patterns and pitting friends against friends,\" he says. \"The next occupant of the White House might want to reconsider the wisdom of using America\u2032s leverage to negotiate one-sided economic treaties that will inevitably breed further resentment a world that is increasingly inclined to distrust United States\u2032 motives about everything.\" <b> <b>Gregg Zachary<\/b>, a former Wall Street Journal reporter, offers his insight on foreign aid in Africa - what works and what doesn\u2032t. \"Poor results largely follow from a failure to take advantage of Africa\u2032s private sector, which is strikingly vibrant and cosmopolitan,\" he writes. \"By leveraging the processes that produce business success, donors would inevitably shift their focus from parasitic to productive enterprises.\" <b> <b>Daniel Gross<\/b>, the Moneybox columnist for Slate, explains why politicians haven\u2032t made many inroads in garnering support from America\u2032s investors. \"There is no investor class.
