The exact mechanisms of how delirium affects the aging brain remain elusive, and this is an area of active research for my group. Along with a team of superb interdisciplinary investigators, we have just been awarded a $13.6 million grant from the National Institute on Aging to examine the pathophysiologic basis and biomarkers for delirium. Using cerebrospinal fluid and plasma assays, electroencephalography, and functional imaging, we will be examining its relationship to Alzheimer\u2019s disease biomarkers, inflammatory biomarkers, neuroimaging changes, and markers of brain plasticity. This study will be an important advance for the field, allowing us to identify mechanisms that we hope will lead to effective treatment strategies in the future. <b>What are the most important parts of building brain health? Are we missing key information about improving brain health?<\/b>The most important parts of building brain health are: exercise, healthy diet, adequate sleep, avoiding tobacco and excessive alcohol, reducing obesity, and treating high blood pressure and diabetes. However, not enough attention is being paid to protecting the brain during illness, hospitalization, and surgery\u2014times when the aging brain is extremely vulnerable to damage that may not be reversible. Much can be done to prevent delirium in these settings\u2014for instance, providing early mobility and exercise, reducing use of immobilizing devices (like bed and chair alarms), assuring orientation and cognitively stimulating activities, enhancing sleep without medications, avoiding dehydration and malnutrition, and minimizing use of psychoactive drugs\u2014those that adversely affect the brain, such as sleeping medications and tranquilizers.

We need to learn how to enhance this resilience and keep the brain highly functional throughout our lives, even with exposure to the many adverse factors that are a part of daily life for all of us. <b>Since delirium is especially common in patients with Alzheimer\u2019s disease, how has your research influenced your views about the disease?<\/b>I view delirium as a great untapped domain for Alzheimer\u2019s disease research and treatment. Understanding where the brain acutely goes wrong holds so many important lessons for the treatment of Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Given that there is growing evidence that delirium can lead to dramatically accelerated cognitive decline in those both with and without Alzheimer\u2019s disease, it represents a critical juncture where intervention may fundamentally alter clinical course. Delirium and Alzheimer\u2019s disease share many underlying pathophysiologic contributors, thus, preventing delirium may, in turn, prevent Alzheimer\u2019s disease.<b>What impact will your research on delirium and cognitive decline have on healthy aging?<\/b>Acute illness and hospitalization occur as part of usual aging for most older adults. Delirium occurs in a substantial proportion of these events, and making sure people can survive and recover well is part of our mission.

There is so much that can be done to enhance the quality of life, ranging from addressing daily activities, living situation, socialization, finding ways to keep them active and engaged.
