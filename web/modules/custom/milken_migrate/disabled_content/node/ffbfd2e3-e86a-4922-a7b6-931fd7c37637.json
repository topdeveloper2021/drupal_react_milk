But the success of this financial tool - mutual fund assets rose from $1.1 trillion to $6.3 trillion from 1990 to 2002 - has also led to a host of regulatory loopholes that have cost small investors billions, explains Rutgers University Professor Eugene White in an article in the latest Milken Institute Review. \"As the market for funds grew and became more sophisticated, opportunities for exploiting the governance structure and liquidity rules appeared,\" says White. \"Conflicts of interest arising from incentive structures and the diversity of fund activities led investment advisers to pay less attention to the interest of fund shareholders.\" White offers his own ideas on how to reform, from more independent directors to changes in the incentives offered fund managers. \"No magic bullet would prevent late trading and market-timing arbitrage,\" he writes. \"It is clear, however, that the reform of mutual fund governance is a key to controlling such abuses.\" Other highlights from the latest Review: G. Pascal Zachary, a senior writer for Business 2.0 magazine, examines the future of Silicon Valley as the center of global technological leadership. \"The big question is not whether the Silicon Valley thrives,\" he writes, \"but whether the region can dominate emerging fields in the way it has dominated computing, software and the Internet.\" <br> Robert Crandall, Robert Hahn, Robert Litan and Scott Wallsten of the American Enterprise Institute-Brookings Joint Center examine the pros and cons of regulating what\u2032s been billed as the Next Big Thing in telecommunications - telephone service over the Internet. \"With the emergence of productive new technologies, the rationale for continuing to regulate local telephone service is rapidly disappearing,\" they write. \"But there will always be pressure to regulate because the losers from new technologies have incentives to use the political process to limit their expected losses, while regulators and legislators are loath to give up the right to divvy up the spoils.\"<br> Laurie Bassi and Daniel McMurrer of Bassi Investments examine the relationship between corporate investments in employee development and stock market performance and find a strong positive correlation between the two.
