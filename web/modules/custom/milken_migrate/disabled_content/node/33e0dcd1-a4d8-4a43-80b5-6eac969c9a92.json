The report examines the current landscape of EMR adoption and profiles innovative health systems that are pioneering the use of EMRs as a research tool. Potential benefits of a research-inclusive EMR would be to: Speed clinical trials by quickly identifying potential enrollees Enhance the monitoring and identification of adverse drug reactions, creating \"virtual clinical trials\" to study the impact of approved drugs <b> Permit early identification of public health threats <br> Provide the research community access to a broader and more diverse patient population <br> Detect patterns of health and illness in a given population Help researchers form hypotheses about disease initiation and progression Since there is a long way to go before EMRs can be widely used in research, several institutions and government agencies have forged ahead to find ways to meld clinical data with research goals. Among the pioneers and innovators: Mayo Clinic converted completely to an EMR system in July 2004. It has 6.5 million patient records electronically indexed and more than 17 million clinical notes retrievable online. Many of the more than 4,000 clinical trials that Mayo conducts each year rely on information from medical records, mainly to identify potential research subjects.
