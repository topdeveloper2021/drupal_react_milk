The optimal design has the following elements: The cap-and-trade program should be free of artificial price caps, sometimes erroneously called \"safety valves.\" These price caps on emissions allowances reduce short-term costs to emitters, but seriously undermine market price signals, slow technological innovation and are a prolonged detour to achieving the needed reductions. <b> It should cover as many sources (and greenhouse gases) as is practical, and regulate emissions at the point in the production chain where it is cheapest.<br> The program should give credit to sources that have already begun to reduce emissions and, once the program is in force, allow emitters to \"bank\" allowances for future use.<br> It should make trading across national borders easier and allow sources to offset their own emissions by reducing emissions from unregulated sources.<br> At least a portion of the fixed number of emissions allowances should be auctioned by the government, creating a clear market price and generating revenues that could be rebated or used for research and development.<br> While program specifics and emissions targets should be reviewed at regular intervals, the basic structure should remain in place for decades in order to encourage long-term planning. Cap-and-trade has been enormously successful in reducing acid rain and environmental damage from coal-fired utilities that emit sulfur dioxide (SO2). In fact, a well-designed cap and trade system can be the base for increased economic productivity and enhanced U.S. competitiveness. The report also serves as a primer on the capital-market aspects of cap-and-trade, defining the concepts involved and demonstrating the projected impact on emissions of various proposed bills.
