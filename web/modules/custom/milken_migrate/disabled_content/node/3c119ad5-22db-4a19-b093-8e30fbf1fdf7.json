Real innovation, the book argues, is focused on increasing transparency and managing risk, unlike the opaque and needlessly complex financial products that wreaked havoc during the crisis. In <b>\"Financing the Future\"<\/b>, co-author Franklin Allen, Nippon Life Professor of Finance and Professor of Economics at The Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, says, \"Since the seismic jolts that shook world markets in 2008, a full-throated debate has raged about whether financial innovation got us into this mess in the first place.\" \"It\u2032s critical that we don\u2032t confuse real financial innovation with intentionally opaque financial products whose sole purpose was speculation or deception,\" said co-author Glenn Yago, Executive Director of Financial Research at the Milken Institute. \"Real financial innovation was not the cause of the crisis, but it is surely needed to accelerate the recovery and fund our future needs.\" The book lays out the historical significance of innovation and its role in creating solutions for business, housing markets, environmental finance, the developing world and medical research. The authors note that if the right tools are deployed responsibly, financial innovation has the capacity to help us shape a more sustainable and prosperous future. Allen and Yago explain how sophisticated capital structures that align the interests of entrepreneurs, investors, non-profits, and governments can enable companies and individuals to raise funding in larger amounts for longer terms and at lower cost - accomplishing tasks that would otherwise be impossible. They recount the history and basic principles of financial innovation, showing how new instruments have evolved and how they have been used and misused. The authors demystify complex capital structures, offering a practical toolbox for entrepreneurs, corporate executives and policymakers. <b>\"Financing the Future\"<\/b> crystallizes the lessons of the recent crisis, offering essential insights for stabilizing the economy and avoiding pitfalls.
