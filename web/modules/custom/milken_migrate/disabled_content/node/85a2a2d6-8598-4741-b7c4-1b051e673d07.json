But even though such spending is among the highest in the developed world -- 5.6 percent of GDP -- the country is behind in employing the relatively new tool of social or \"impact\" investing, which leads to social good while delivering a financial return to companies.A new report from the Milken Institute, \"Building a Social Capital Market in Israel,\" explores ways that impact investing can help the nation's social sector evolve.\n\"We identified a large gap in the marketplace, which is an important step toward building a complete social investing system in Israel,\" said Glenn Yago, senior director at the Milken Institute and founder of its Financial Innovations Labs. \"We've captured the best advice of top experts in impact investing, and we believe the time is right for bringing new approaches to Israel, where there\u2019s great receptivity to innovation.\"\nThe report recommends ways to overcome barriers, including legal and regulatory restrictions, revenue challenges, and access to capital. It details specific approaches for scaling up current financing programs, replicating best practices from other nations, establishing a social investment fund, and creating policy tools to provide incentives for social investment in Israel. Among the tools that can be used to attract capital to Israel's social investment market are increasing limits on tax deductions, allowing tax credits to be carried forward and made transferable, and instituting tax-exempt financing.\nThe report also suggests a number of policy changes:\n\u2022 Allow the creation of \"benefit corporations\" that represent a hybrid of non-profit and profit-making enterprises;<br> \u2022 Allow the creation of philanthropic funds as a way of spurring the growth of available capital; and<br> \u2022 Create a classification for social enterprise bonds, similar to U.S. 501(c)(3) bonds, to raise longer-term, lower-cost funds in the capital markets.\n\"Building a Social Capital Market in Israel\" emerged from a Milken Institute Financial Innovations Lab held in May where the National Economic Council and leaders in Israeli, U.S., and U.K. social investing markets met to help prepare a roadmap for a social investing framework.\nYago, together with other financial, business and technology innovators, will participate today in the panel, \"Impact Investing: Israel as a Launching Pad for Social Investment,\" at the Globes Israel Business Conference at the David Intercontinental Hotel in Tel Aviv.
