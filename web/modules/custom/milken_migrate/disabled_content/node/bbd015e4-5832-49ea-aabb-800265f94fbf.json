A new report from the Milken Institute, <b> Scaling Enterprise Finance: The Future of Biofuels<\/b>, looks at how to jumpstart investment in biofuels R&D, production and distribution, using mechanisms from expanded futures markets to crop insurance. Global ethanol and biodiesel production revenues reached $34.8 billion in 2008. However, when compared to the $1.76 trillion in revenues generated by the top five oil companies in the world, it\u2032s evident that biofuels have a long way to go before the industry matures. \"Biofuels show great promise, but building a network of processing plants, nationwide distribution systems and retail outlets requires a lot more investment than what we have now,\" said Joel Kurtzman, Executive Director of the Center for a Sustainable Energy Future at the Milken Institute. \"We need to align the policies, incentives and the flow of capital quickly - and there are financial tools that can help get the job done.\" Improvements are currently being made across the board in biofuels. Ethanol was once labeled a negative use of energy, but technological advances have increased the yield of corn-based ethanol to 2.3 units (dry mill) for every unit input (sugarcane-based ethanol has a yield of 9.3 energy units). Other sources, including biomass waste and algae-based biodiesel, are also promising, but require further R&D. Each of these sources will need capital to bring it to the next stage of development and deployment. Finding that capital, however, can be a challenge. Investors have been rocked by the recession and tight credit markets. The private sector is waiting for government-backed assurances before taking on additional risk, while government agencies, such as the Department of Energy, are looking for assurance that there is interest from the private sector before providing grants.
