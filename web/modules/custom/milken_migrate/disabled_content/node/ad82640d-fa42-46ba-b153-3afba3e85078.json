    "value": "The development of the syndicated loan market has led to a \"quiet revolution\" in America\u2032s capital market and has allowed the U.S. economy to avoid a damaging credit crunch during the last recession, according to a new study from the Milken Institute. \"This market, without great fanfare, has been one of the most rapidly growing and innovating sections of the U.S. capital market in the past 20 years,\" says the report, The U.S. Leveraged Loan Market: A Primer. Glenn Yago, the Institute\u2032s Director of Capital Studies and one of the report\u2032s authors, said that the last recession was shorter and shallower because banks were able to find buyers for loans and renew lending faster. \"Without the type of credit crunch that accompanied earlier business cycles, our economic recovery has been swifter thanks to loan syndication and trading,\" Yago said. The study, funded in part by the Loan Syndications and Trading Association (LSTA), offers the first in-depth analysis of this vast and largely unknown market and how it functions, including its value to investors, borrowers and lenders, and a description of the innovations and assets that have originated in it. \"Syndicated loans have proven themselves to be an attractive asset class with low correlations to other assets, low volatility of returns and an attractive risk\/return profile compared to many other traditional fixed-income investment categories,\" says the report. As a bridge of sorts between private and public debt markets, the syndicated loan market - in which a loan is provided not by one lender, but a group of lending institutions - has emerged as an important investment tool. The development of this market is important for several reasons: It provides borrowers with an alternative to high-yield bonds and conventional bank loans, and in doing so provides much-needed credit to lower-rated companies. <b> In times of adversity, banks can sell portions of the syndicated credits into a relatively liquid secondary market and actively manage the risks in their portfolios. This allows them to avoid unnecessary lending restrictions when the economy contracts. This helps prevent a credit crunch in the U.S. economy.<br> It has led to the creation of a new asset class with greater return per unit of risk than many other fixed-income assets. Thanks to a number of financial innovations that have led to the creation of new asset classes, and the growth of the secondary market, the syndicated loan market has increased tremendously in the past 20 years. The secondary market has grown by more than 1,600 percent in the past 12 years - from $8 billion in trading volume in 1991 to $135 billion in 2003. And the leveraged side of this market has become the largest and fastest-growing section. Another reason for these increases is increased transparency in the market, with credit ratings and independent data and research giving investors much more information, the study says. \"From its origins as a relatively arcane market characterized by the absence of public information, the syndicated loan market has become much more transparent and information is increasingly available to outsiders rather than just a handful of large banks,\" the authors say. The study, which was co-authored by Research Analyst Don McCarthy of the Institute, can be used by investors and other parties to better understand this market, including its investment returns and risks.
