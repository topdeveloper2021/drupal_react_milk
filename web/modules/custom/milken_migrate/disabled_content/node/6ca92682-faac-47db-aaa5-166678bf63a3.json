That failure was one of the motivations for the book, the editors say, along with a wish to put together a blueprint for bond-market development that might be used by other countries that lack robust debt capital markets. Asia\u2032s Debt Capital Markets provides a comprehensive and detailed analysis of the importance of these markets to all countries, regardless of geographic location. It includes an up-to-date appraisal of the underlying financial infrastructure contributing to the Asian crisis and an assessment of current economic conditions. The book\u2032s 10 essays make the argument that active debt markets will improve national and regional resource allocation by providing an unbiased, visible price mechanism and widen the choices available to investors. The essays stem from discussions at the first Asian Bond Market Forum, co-hosted by the Milken Institute and the University of Hong Kong, in 2003 in Hong Kong. The book is the sixth in the Milken Institute Series on Financial Innovation and Economic Growth, organized by Glenn Yago and James Barth of the Milken Institute.
