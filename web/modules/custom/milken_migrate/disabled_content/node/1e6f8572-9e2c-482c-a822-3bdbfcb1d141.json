    "value": "SHANGHAI AND NEW YORK, January 18, 2007 - Xinhua Finance and Milken Institute today released updated values for their Chinese Initial Public Offering (IPO) Indicator and Renminbi Pressure Indicator (RPI). The IPO Indicator rose nearly 20% in December, mainly due to the continued strong performance of Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC\/Code: A Share, 601398; H Share, 1398). The RPI continued its upward trend, increasing 0.86 percent in October, a slight acceleration from its 0.75 percent rise over the previous month.The updated indicator charts can be found at chinaindicators.milkeninstitute.org or www.xinhuafinance.com\/en\/charts\/ipo_rpi\/0701.html.\nThe IPO Indicator tracks the share price performance of new issues of mainland Chinese firms listed on the Shanghai, Shenzhen and Hong Kong stock exchanges. The RPI indicates upward or downward pressure on the RMB as compared to the U.S. dollar exchange rate, as determined by changes in three primary factors: the percentage change in the nominal exchange rate and the change in domestic interest rates, as well as the percentage change in China\u2032s foreign exchange reserves. The two indicators are part of a series of eight indicators designed to increase transparency within China\u2032s emerging financial markets.\nThe IPO Indicator for December was 237.8, a 19.6% increase from November. ICBC shares accounted for 76% of the overall increase. Of the 81 issuances comprising the indicator, 47 rose, while 34 dropped during the month. Of the 20 new IPOs that generated US$4 billion in proceeds, China Coal (H Share, 1898) led the pack, raising US$1.7 billion.\nIn China\u2032s currency market, the RPI continued its upward trajectory in October. While both RMB appreciation and accumulating foreign exchange reserves drove the indicator higher, the rate of appreciation lagged behind the previous month, slowing to 0.37 percent from 0.63 percent in September. Foreign exchange reserves exceeded US$1.01 trillion, a 2.19 percent monthly increase, against a 1.63 percent increase in September. Interest rates did not change.\nGlenn Yago, Director of Capital Studies at the Milken Institute, said, \"Looking ahead to next month, China Life\u2032s listing will have an impact, mitigating some of the dominant role ICBC is playing in the IPO indicator.\" China Life (A Share, 601628) was listed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange on January 9, 2007, marking the first listing of an insurer in Mainland China. China Life shares more than doubled in their first day of trading.\nHe added, \"Meanwhile, the RPI continues along its linear ascent, showing no sign of reversal, indicating a further strengthening in appreciation pressures.\" Both the IPO Indicator and RPI are calculated monthly and released mid-month. The next releases of the IPO and Renminbi Pressure indicators will be in mid-February 2007.\nThe Xinhua Finance\/Milken Institute China Indicators are designed to increase transparency and data quality in China\u2032s burgeoning financial markets. The series applies the world-class index calculation methodologies of Milken Institute, one of the world\u2032s leading economic and financial research think tanks, and the extensive data resources of Xinhua Finance, China\u2032s premier financial information and media service provider.
