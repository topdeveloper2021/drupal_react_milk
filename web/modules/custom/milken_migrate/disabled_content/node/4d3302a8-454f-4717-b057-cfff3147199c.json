The 18-month research project led by the US SIF Foundation investigated how to broaden the network of investors committed to community development finance, an especially urgent task given that many forms of community investment are closely tied to public support and tax expenditures that face uncertain futures in a period of constrained public resources.The report's authors, in addition to recommending ways to attract new accredited and institutional investors, urged community investing advocates to develop products that are liquid enough to attract retail investors and are readily available through the investment platforms retail investors typically use. The report, intended both as a practical guide for those who develop and manage community development vehicles and as a primer and list of resources for potential investors, draws on interviews and conversations with representatives of over a dozen community development investment vehicles and more than 30 current and potential community investors, including foundations, pension funds, wealth management firms and asset managers.US SIF Foundation led the project in collaboration with the Initiative for Responsible Investment at the Hauser Institute for Civil Society at Harvard University and the Milken Institute.Lisa Woll, the CEO of US SIF Foundation, said: \"It is time for investors to take another look at the options available in the community investment space.
