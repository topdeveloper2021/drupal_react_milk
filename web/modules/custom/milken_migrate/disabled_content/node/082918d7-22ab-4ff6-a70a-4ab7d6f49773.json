Call it adaptive reuse for the human-capital set.Consider Fred Gyger, who retired after 35 years in the semiconductor industry, and now runs four resale stores for Habitat for Humanity, improving performance and profits. Teresa Carstens, a senior Silicon Valley marketing professional, is developing programs to engage and retain volunteers with Second Harvest Food Bank of Santa Clara\/San Mateo Counties, which provides more than a million pounds of food a week to low-income residents.Dr. Elisa Ross sought a way to make a difference after 25 years in private practice. Discovering a passion for data science, she improved health outcomes and cancer screenings at the clinic where she was a fellow. \u201cUsing her wealth of clinical experience and our data, Elisa created a program to increase cancer screening rates [by] almost 50 percent.
