Collectively, Sharia-compliant banks are forecast to grow at a rate of 20 percent a year through 2019, albeit from a low base. Despite this growth and record level of sukuk (Islamic Bond) issuance, the industry as a whole is still largely concentrated in the banking sector, creating the risk of government bailouts. Participants on this panel will discuss the expansion of Islamic finance and the effects it may have on capital flows and development. Will opportunities exist to expand into areas such as trade and infrastructure financing in Asia and Africa, where foreign banks have scaled back? Can regulatory and conventional market structures be aligned with the needs of Sharia-compliant intermediaries and their customers? What can be done to reduce fragmentation in Islamic finance markets due to differences in accepted standards of Sharia compliance?",
