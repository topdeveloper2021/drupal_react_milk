It's unique to each company and depends on capital market conditions, the economy, management capabilities, industry trends and--most importantly--the regulatory environment and social trends.

Overleveraging can leave a company hamstrung, just as avoiding debt at the wrong times can lead to missed opportunities for growth and job creation. For some companies, the constant focus on short-term financing leaves less time for long-term planning. Finding the right capital structure is both an art and a science, and the best practitioners understand their environment and draw from a broad range of financial tools. This panel will discuss why capital structure matters now more than ever. How are risk levels affected by current government regulation and social trends? When is it time to build liquidity? How can companies anticipate interest-rate and market cycles to avoid the wrong structure?",
