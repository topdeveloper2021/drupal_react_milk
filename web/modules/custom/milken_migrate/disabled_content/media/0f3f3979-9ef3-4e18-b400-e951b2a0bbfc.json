This panel will explore how the world's great and soon-to-be-great cities can stay flexible in the face of change and maintain vibrant, livable communities. What are planners, architects and government officials doing to solve pressing urban challenges, such as affordable housing and efficient, high-capacity transportation? How can they, and others with good ideas, design metropolises that are conducive to economic vitality, environmental sustainability, social inclusiveness and creativity--the strengths that will enable these population magnets to thrive in the future?",
