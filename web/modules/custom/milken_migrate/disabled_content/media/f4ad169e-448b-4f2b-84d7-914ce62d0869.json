However, the first curative therapies are already here, and the wave is coming. The Food and Drug Administration approved three gene- and cell-based therapies last year. In contrast to traditional therapeutics that alleviate symptoms alone, gene- and cell-based therapies hold the promise of treating the underlying cause of a disorder for long periods of time, perhaps even curing or preventing disease. Excitement around recent approvals of the first gene therapies comes with a desire to speed development of similar therapeutics in the pipeline, as well as concern over upfront costs that could run hundreds of thousands of dollars for each patient. How do we ensure that patients get access for durable therapies while companies are rewarded for their investment? Some are turning to financial innovation, hoping to reallocate payment timing, risk, and incentives among stakeholders in the supply chain to promote access to durable therapies for those who need it. This panel will explore several approaches to financial innovation in the quest to find a cure for the cost of durable therapies.",
