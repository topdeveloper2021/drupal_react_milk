This past year, bipartisan leadership championed and ushered the passage of the FIRST STEP Act in an effort to reform our federal prison system and reduce recidivism. This legislation was an important step toward repairing a broken system, yet much work is yet to be done. Who are the leaders at the forefront of criminal justice reform?
