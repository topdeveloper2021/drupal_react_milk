Many point out that the shale oil boom has reduced U.S. dependence on oil imports, limiting the stimulus that typically results from low prices. And the stronger dollar is a problem for U.S. exporters and companies that must convert foreign earnings into U.S. currency. Other questions arise. Are bond markets underestimating the timing and speed of Fed interest rate hikes? Might equity valuations be harmed by higher interest rates?
