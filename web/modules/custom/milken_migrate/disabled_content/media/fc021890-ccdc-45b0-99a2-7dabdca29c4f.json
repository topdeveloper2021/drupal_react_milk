Historically, young people depended on the government to provide public-sector jobs, but that path has been disrupted by conflict and declining oil revenue. The need for a private-sector alternative is clear, but serious obstacles loom. Too many young people are ill-prepared for the business world and investors are deterred by corruption and instability. Change will require state-based economies, many dependent on oil exports, to embrace private enterprise. But can entrepreneurship thrive in this part of the world? Can schools be changed to emphasize business and technical skills? And are leaders strong enough to enact the necessary reforms? This panel will discuss the challenges and consider ways to foster economic growth.",
