Early support for marriage equality from Wall Street, tech communities and the entertainment industry drove that process forward.

Now the Supreme Court is about to rule on whether gay marriage must be permitted in all 50 states, and business groups have submitted briefs in support. Why has the partnership between business and gay rights been so successful? Why have American businesses been able to have such a profound impact on public policy in this area while experiencing bigger challenges in others, like immigration, the environment and healthcare. What are the lessons that can be learned from this partnership? And is there still room for debate in the business community about LGBT issues?",
