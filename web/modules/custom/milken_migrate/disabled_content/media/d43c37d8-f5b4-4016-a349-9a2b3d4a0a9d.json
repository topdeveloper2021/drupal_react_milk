On this panel, we ask several questions: what impact did central banks' decision to increase interest rates on investors credit strategies? And how are the adjusting for additional monetary policy changes? How are investors adjusting to concerns that credit terms might be getting weaker? What are some of the less obvious challenges facing this asset class? How will 2018 come to close for credit investors and what should investors expect for 2019?
