# Overview / Content Strategy #

In general, every websites has two types of content: ELEMENTAL CONTENT and COMPOSED CONTENT.

**ELEMENTAL CONTENT** is the content it makes sense to include in the together because they more or less always be used together in the same context. Examples: A video with a short description and thumbnail (The thumbnail and video description would never be used on its own so it makes sense to link the description and a thumbnail of the video to the video object itself) A single slide with a headline subhead and linkage; An author's social media links and contact information. The dividing line for what is and is not "elemental" is whether the data will always or almost always be used together in context. If the data is reusable, it should, ideally, be its own data entity.

**COMPOSED CONTENT** is content that is made of several elemental pieces. Like LEGOâ„¢ blocks elemental content is used to create complex content structures. Examples of composed content: A press release with links, video embeds and logos; An article that references an author that has written multiple things on your site and has a blog of his own with which we share linkage; A landing page with a series of slides describing the focus and scope of a current program.

In this site paradigm we reserve "node" types for composed content. The node almost always combines multiple elements from disparate media to present to the viewer an idea. To that end we've created a couple of different content types:

1. Landing Pages
   Landing pages consist of a URL, meta tags and a series of paragraph references to elemental content.

2. Event Pages
   Page where speakers, location information, and panel/session information is displayed concerning a single meeting, conference or other event.

3. Opportunity
   A philanthropy opportunity consists of possible actions, region information, link to another website, and maybe some taxonomy about the oportunity's focus.

4. Article
   An article is composed of a headline, body text and zero or more linkages to authors, media, programs, centers and/or url links.
